 mpo_special_flavor_events.0001.desc: "I heard tales about the sea. About its beauty and its terror and how it eclipses even the dry land in both. Today, I see the great water myself for the first time.\n\nAnd finally I understand the gleam in raconteurs' eyes while they scrambled for words to describe the endless water. I sit down and stare into the horizon, where the familiar clear sky gently touches the blue water.\n\nI feel salty mist softly caressing my face. The serene rhythm of waves fills my ears. The tranquility of the sea is overwhelming, if only for a moment."
