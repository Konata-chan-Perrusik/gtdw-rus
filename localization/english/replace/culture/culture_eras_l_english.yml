 culture_era_tribal:0 "Classical"
 culture_era_tribal_desc:0 "The Classical Era of a [culture|E] predates the emergence of the modern legal structures and governments of [aeras|E] and chronologically stretches from [prehistory|E] to the formation of the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarinas Aautokrata')|E]. While generally associated with the ancients, many societies and tribes have continued to advance despite never evolving their governments. Rulers with [tribal_government|E] can only make use of Classical Era [innovations|E]."
 culture_era_early_medieval:0 "Draconic"
 culture_era_early_medieval_desc:0 "The Draconic Era (often called the [Concept('aversaria','Early-Imperial')|E] era) refers to the age between the decline of Classical [Concept('the_continent','Continental')|E] society and the 5th century death of the last known dragon, [arthenax|E]. The near-simultaneous collapse of the decaying institutions of most of the Continent's major polities gave birth to a number of important [innovations|E], allowing [cultures|E] to reform and be reborn."
 culture_era_high_medieval:0 "Saintly"
 culture_era_high_medieval_desc:0 "The Saintly Era was a time of great change and reckoning for much of the [Concept('the_continent','Continent')|E]. The chaotic end to the Classical Era had left many unanswered questions and half-resolved crises which by the 6th century began to manifest in mass civil and religious unrest. Radical and esoteric thought became exceptionally more common and nearly all remaining ancient institutions and faiths met their end in their wake. The Saintly Era is generally considered to have begun to end with the Agionist Rebellions."
 culture_era_late_medieval:0 "Renewal"
 culture_era_late_medieval_desc:0 "The Renewal Era may be considered the end of the echoes of the Classical era of the [Concept('the_continent','Continent')|E]. With [frodbrokna|E] and the emergence of the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E], nearly all of the last [Concept('aversaria','decaying remnants')|E] of the old times have [Concept('sjalvolki_migration','given way')|E] to refugees, migrants and adventurers. While the [Concept('aeras','world')|E] is [Concept('the_rift', 'scarred')|E] and dying, mankind still lives and pushes onward into the unknown. With the last remnants of the past forgotten and buried with the bygone Age of Heroes, new societies and institutions may yet build a better world upon the ashes."
