 reactive_advice_hunting_intro_desc:0 "Hunting in Godherja has been massively revamped from Vanilla to be both more risky and rewarding.\nOpen this to receive some hints & tips about how best to approach the wilderness of [aeras|E]!"
 reactive_advice_hunting_basics_desc:0 "Across [aeras|E], there is a greater diversity of fauna that can be hunted compared to Vanilla. This can range from small rodents and rabbits to enormous elephants and mammoths. It can be incredibly difficult to successfully hunt the largest of game, but the rewards will come to match.\n\nSimilarly, you are no longer limited to hunt purely in your [realm|E]. With the [GetPerk('adept_tracker_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] [perk|E], you can hunt in other realms too (so long as they have a positive [opinion|E] of you and are within range)."
 reactive_advice_hunting_biozones_desc:0 "[Concept('biozone','Biozones')|E] are a term to describe regions with similar biomes and shared histories. You can see them ingame through the Biozone Mapmode highlighted on the bottom right of your HUD.\n\nBiozones will generally have different and unique fauna types across them. While some animals will range across multiple Biozones, many (especially unique [monsters|E]) may only be found in specific locations."
 reactive_advice_hunting_monsters_desc:0 "Apart from hunting normal animals, you can also hunt [monsters|E] on [aeras|E]. Monster Hunting is a separate option from Standard Hunts and Falconry within the [GetActivityType('activity_hunt').GetName] [activity|E]. You gain access through the [adventure_lifestyle|E], though you may find a [core_tenet|E] or [tradition|E] that unlocks it as well.\n\n Monster Hunts can be very perilous compared to normal hunts, so make sure you are prepared ahead of time for the danger that lies ahead."
 reactive_advice_hunting_advancement_rewards_desc:0 "Hunting can provide many different rewards dependent on your skill as a Hunter, and if youve taken it, your [adventure_lifestyle|E]. Tales will sing of the Fog-Slayer who felled a dozen Fogbeasts. Hides and Skulls, Poisons and Gems—[artifacts|E] of all kinds can be collected as trophies from your hunts. The more dangerous your prey is, the greater the glory for taking its head!\n\nCharacters with the Hunter [trait|E] can rank up their Beasthunter track through monster hunting as well. The more perilous the hunt, the more experience you're likely to get!"
