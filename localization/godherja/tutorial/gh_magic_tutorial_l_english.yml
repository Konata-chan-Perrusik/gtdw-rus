 reactive_advice_magic_intro_desc:0 "[magic|E] in Godherja has seen many changes over the years so whether you are completely new or coming back after a long time, this tutorial is for you. Let's take a look at how it works and how you can use magic to improve your realm."
 reactive_advice_magic_basics:0 "Magic 101: The Basics"
 reactive_advice_magic_basics_desc:0 "Here in the Character Screen, [magi|E] will be able to see their [aspect|E] [skills|E] and [magic_type|E]. Your [Concept('aspect','Aspects')|E] determine your strength and expertise with casting in that discipline, meanwhile your [Concept('magic_type','School')|E] determines what Aspects you have trained with.\nYou will also sometimes have inheritable Magic traits that benefit your character's Magic Baselines. Your [magic_baseline|E] and [extended_magic_baseline|E] determine how much magic you will naturally be able to hold, and how much you can safely possess before experiencing [magic_exposure|E]."
 reactive_advice_magic_casting:0 "Magic 101: Spellcasting"
 reactive_advice_magic_casting_desc:0 "The Spellcasting Screen is where the [magic|E] happens. Here you will find any Spells that you know and what effects they might have. You will generally be able to Overcharge your spells for stronger effects, though they will grow more difficult to cast. While every spell can be applied directly to yourself or land, you will sometimes want to target someone else, and can do so through the Character Interaction or through the Province Screen.\n\nAll casting comes with drawbacks though, in the next lesson we will take a look at what forms that takes."
 reactive_advice_magic_overwhelmation:0 "Magic 101: Overwhelmation & You"
 reactive_advice_magic_overwhelmation_desc:0 "When [magi|E] cast their spells, their bodies are put under incredible strain that often take years of training to withstand. This strain is known as [overwhelmation|E], and occurs any time Magi go beyond what they are capable of. Overwhelmation can be very dangerous, even deadly, so it is wise to be careful with what you attempt. You can track your Overwhelmation through the highlighted meter on your HUD.\n\nIt's also important to not confuse Overwhelmation with [magic_exposure|E], which we will cover in the final lesson."
 reactive_advice_magic_exposure:0 "Magic 101: Exposure Sickness"
 reactive_advice_magic_exposure_desc:0 "Sometimes when a [magi|E] has been too heavily exposed to [mana|E], they can experience [exposure_sickness|E]. This can happen often for Magi that are regularly casting or spelunking through places of power, but it is important to separate this from [overwhelmation|E], which normally stems from going beyond your limits. If your character is experiencing Exposure Sickness, your [magic|E] meter on the HUD will fill,similarly to your [stress_level|E], and you will temporarily gain a [GetTrait('gh_magicsickness_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] [trait|E]. Your Exposure level will [Concept('aftoenischi_effect', 'decay')] over time (thus losing the trait), but for the duration of your sickness, your character will suffer health penalties and be more at risk of [mutations|E]. Further casting (or exposure) can exacerbate this, with deadly consequences."
