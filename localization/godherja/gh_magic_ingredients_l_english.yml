 rockleaf_name:0 "Rockleaf"
 rockleaf_desc:0 "A vigorous mountain vine that grows on boulders battered both by Sun and snow, Rockleaf's crunchy foliage is occasionally consumed for its numbing properties, but is usually avoided for the tongue and joint stiffness that often accompanies this."
 black_laudanum_name:0 "Black Laudanum"
 black_laudanum_desc:0 "Night poppy is known to guarantee a deep, dreamless sleep for weeks even when consumed in a relatively unrefined form, and can also double as a fairly powerful painkiller. The black tincture that is extracted from it is so powerful that it can cause the user to never wake up if taken at even slightly excessive doses."
 sanguine_nectar_name:0 "Sanguine Nectar"
 sanguine_nectar_desc:0 "Though Maklea's Rose may not be a particularly rare flower in the arid highlands of Etepezea and Opakhasia, and is even sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, extracting its famed nectar is a long and very difficult process. The result, however, is an incredible substance that transforms pain into pleasure and amplifies all sensation."
 deathcap_name:0 "Deathcap"
 deathcap_desc:0 "The humble Deathcap is a mushroom that needs little introduction; among the most standard ingredients for traditional poisonmakers, it also sees some utilization by [magi|E], but its usefulness in this regard is significantly limited in comparison — it seems to lose most of its potency unless only exposed to very specific arcane energies, and is a generally finnicky reagent that seems to make spells more difficult to control."
 ancient_yew_needles_name:0 "Ancient Yew Needles"
 ancient_yew_needles_desc:0 "Yew trees are well-known as magically potent, and this property only becomes more pronounced with their age. The most ancient specimens are likely to be older than human civilization itself, and even a handful of their needles has a powerful stabilizing effect on local arcane energies."
 mud_hemlock_name:0 "Mud Hemlock"
 mud_hemlock_desc:0 "Fetid-smelling and extremely toxic, the Mud Hemlock grows only in the deepest corners of Aeras' most damp swamps.

Their remains will so rapidly decompose into a rotting mush that a dignified burial is likely to prove impossible."
 sunset_oleander_name:0 "Sunset Oleander"
 sunset_oleander_desc:0 "Cultivated in the ancient gardens of the Kemsarian Empire, Sunset Oleander is a flower renowned both for its beauty and deadliness. While inhaling its vapors from a distance causes a pleasant high, even a single direct sniff will cause the victim collapse dead in a matter of seconds."
 ojyczanyz_sorrow_name:0 "Ojyczanyz Sorrow"
 ojyczanyz_sorrow_desc:0 "A sturdy flower once prized in Ojyczanyz gardens for its ability to soak in the colors of surrounding life, nowadays it is one of the very few plant species still present in the Lichdoms. Though nontoxic when fully colored, the translucent, ghostly form that still grows in the Lichdoms is known to plunge those that consume it into a profoundly deep depression — usually only ending with the victim's death from grief or suicide."
 ambergris_name:0 "Ambergris"
 ambergris_desc:0 "Prized in both perfume making and occasionally cooking, ambergris is a waxy, [aspect_water]-imbued substance well-known for its properties as an arcane fixative."
 lovers_hawthorn_name:0 "Lovers' Hawthorn"
 lovers_hawthorn_desc:0 "The fruits of a relatively uncommon Hawthorn species, these berries often find themselves as the main ingredient of aphrodisiacs and love potions.

 gum_khenemhati_name:0 "Gum Khenemhati"
 gum_khenemhati_desc:0 "The hardened resin of an acacia endemic to Khenemhat, this sweet gum is best known for being a common ingredient in Sarradonian confectionaries, but is also sometimes used as a component in cheap healing mixtures. "

 dragon_scale_name:0 "Dragon Scale"
 dragon_scale_desc:0 "While the [dragons|E] were destroyed by [aversaria|E] long ago, farmers still sometimes uncover ancient scales so old that they've long turned to stone. Despite that they remain warm to the touch and impart a sense of 'aliveness' to any who come across one. Exceptionally wealthy [magi|E] and Aironoians have been known to inhale powdered Dragon Scale both as a mark of wealth and due to its alleged ability to make its consumers 'ride the dragon', as they say. Most, however, see more value in the high amounts of magic embedded deep within the ancient stone."
 flawless_diamond_name:0 "Flawless Diamond"
 flawless_diamond_desc:0 "The grandest and most pure of the mundane gemstones, a diamond of this perfection would be the envy of any a crown — and a fortifying magical reagent nearly without peer."

 thunder_scarred_bark_desc:0 "Most often the bark of oak trees, wood that has been repeatedly subject to the awesome power of lightning has numerous curious properties, but one stands out in particular — if treated in a specific way and left under a storm, it is all but guaranteed to draw thunder to itself every few minutes.

 last_sigh_desc:0 "Odorless and tasteless, the Last Sigh would be the poison of choice for any conspirator were it not for its extreme rarity. Born only in those places where extreme amounts of blood have been spilled, and where the most vile magics known to man have been used. The flower is beautiful, of the purest white, but for all its beauty it is also extremely toxic, as it is the most powerful poison known to man, which, once ingested, will cause the victim's guts to begin to rot at an extremely rapid rate."

 cerebrospinalis_concentrate_desc:0 "The use of this pain reliever is extremely taboo because of its ability to transfer one person's pain to another, and the way it is "harvested" requires scraping out a man's brain.

The stone is situated inside the snake's head, and to remove it, one needs to kill the snake.
