Under Gardfrei's reign, exploitation of the site began in earnest, but the sovereign's direct interest in the matter waned with his growing obsession over more esoteric affairs, and the venture would quickly show the cracks of administrative neglect."

It took fiften years for the project to be completed, and the Baron practically emptied his treasury in the process, but the result was as formidable in the mundane sense as it was magically; reportedly the walls even had forbidden Ojyczanyz rites woven into it.\n\nMere years later, the troubles afflicting the Reach came to a fever pitch with the [Glossary('War of the Black Yew', 'WAR_OF_THE_BLACK_YEW_GLOSS')], and Dragoncourt found itself besieged by one of [Glossary('Carttuen Silver-Hair', 'CARTTUEN_SILVER_HAIR_GLOSS')]'s most monstrous redcap hordes, which ultimately failed to take the castle and vanished upon Carttuen's defeat. Later on, the Kingdom of Mountain and Reach would improve these defenses even further, correctly seeing the castle as pivotal for preventing an Aversarian reconquest of the region — which it would six times, before Eramos managed to take it by trickery in 727 IS upon the opening of his Great Northern March."

Development was hindered by the dense forests of Knothos and the mine-head's placement at considerable elevation caused difficulties. It was often remarked that the mine was likely deadlier to reach than it was to actually work in. The chaos of the [odrstund|E], the [imperial_civil_war|E], and finally the [frodbrokna|E] put the mine out of business as interests in Malcois turned towards matters of survival over exploiting an underdeveloped alpine mine. With life slowly being breathed back into the province, the Oetanai gold mine has seen increased development. The settlement huddled near the mine-head begins to crowd the plateau upon which it perches.

Aversarian explorers upon returning home tried to find any telltale signs of the facility or even be able to spot the tower from the ground below, but it blends into the surroundings like a snow leopard might blend into the snow.
