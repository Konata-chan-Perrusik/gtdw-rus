 gh_colonization_events.0001.t:90 "Colonization: Peace and Prosperity"
 gh_colonization_events.0001.desc:90 "Recent reports from [colony.GetNameNoTier] seem to suggest that the colony is enjoying an unprecedented degree of success, with scores of new enthusiastic settlers arriving in the province each day to seek wealth and fortune.\n\nShould the things continue to progress in this way, it would not be too long until the region will become a fully-fledged part of my realm."
 gh_colonization_events.0001.a:90 "Let them enjoy the fruits of their labors."
 gh_colonization_events.0001.b:90 "They can start paying their taxes early."
 gh_colonization_events.0001.c:90 "Good infrastructure will serve [colony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] in the long term."
 gh_colonization_events.0001.d:90 "Their taxes will #EMP double#!."
 gh_colonization_events.0001.d.tt:90 "[colonization_progress|E] in [colony.GetName] will decrease by #X 20#!"

 gh_colonization_events.0002.t:90 "Colonization: A Plague of Brigands"
 gh_colonization_events.0002.desc:90 "Recently, the magistrates in charge of my colony in [colony.GetNameNoTier] have been sending increasingly distressing reports about a large band of brigands that has been gaining power in the province. Drawing recruits from disgruntled settlers and opportunistic vagabonds alike, they carry out attacks on merchant caravans and pillage frontier settlements, wreaking havoc on the land and its peoples.\n\nAt the rate their numbers are growing, it would not be long before this wave of banditry spills into the surrounding territories, undermining my authority and control."
 gh_colonization_events.0002.a:90 "They will have to deal with it by themselves."
 gh_colonization_events.0002.a.tt:90 "The [control|E] level in all [counties|E] in your [realm|E] that are adjacent to the [colony.GetName] will change by #X -20#!"
 gh_colonization_events.0002.b:90 "Double the patrols, and guard the roads."
 gh_colonization_events.0002.c:90 "Dispatch a punitive force to hunt down the bandits."
 gh_colonization_events.0002.d:90 "[court_adventurer.GetFirstName] will deal with this."
 gh_colonization_events.0002.d.tt:90 "Your [GetCourtPositionType('court_adventurer_court_position').GetName()] dispatches the rabble without issue"

 gh_colonization_events.0003.t:90 "Colonization: Food Shortage"
 gh_colonization_events.0003.desc:90 "A combination of poor harvests, depleted wildlife, and delayed shipments has led to a food shortage in the colony of [colony.GetNameNoTier], with the remaining stores being only barely enough to sustain the local communities for another week or two.\n\nIn the face of the coming crisis, the settlers' representatives have come to me with a desperate plea for assistance, warning that if nothing is done about this looming plight, the province may face widespread starvation and strife."
 gh_colonization_events.0003.a:90 "They will have to fend for themselves."
 gh_colonization_events.0003.a.tt:90 "[colonization_progress|E] decreases by #X 30#!"
 gh_colonization_events.0003.b:90 "Send them enough food to survive the year."

 gh_colonization_events.0004.t:90 "Colonization: An Incompetent Administrator"
 gh_colonization_events.0004.desc:90 "A [idiot.GetWomanMan] in chains is brought before me by [jailor.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], falling onto the floor in a heap after a strong push from the latter. With no small amount of surprise, I learn that this person is supposed to be one of the chief administrators of my colony in [colony.GetNameNoTier], accused of deeds that can only be explained by either criminal negligence or complete lunacy.\n\nSupposedly, [idiot.GetSheHe] has almost single-handedly brought the entire community to ruin by wasting supplies, obstructing essential work for the sake holding no fewer than a dozen meetings per day, and levying harsh taxes to fund the construction of a 'Governor's Mansion'.\n\nIf even half of that is true, then it is a mystery how [idiot.GetSheHe] got [idiot.GetHerHis] position in the first place."
 gh_colonization_events.0004.a:90 "Get this fool out of my sight."
 gh_colonization_events.0004.a.tt:90 "[idiot.GetFirstName] is banished from the realm, never to be seen again"
 gh_colonization_events.0004.b:90 "Have this lackwit thrown into the dungeon!"
 gh_colonization_events.0004.c:90 "[jailor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], execute this dullard."

 gh_colonization_events.0005.t:90 "Colonization: Monster Infestation"
 gh_colonization_events.0005.desc:90 "A messenger from [colony.GetNameNoTier] has appeared before my court with the most dire news: a horde of monsters has overrun the colony! Driven into a frenzy by the settlers' arrival in the region, the beasts are rampaging through the countryside, devastating hamlets and laying waste to villages. Contact with many settlements has already been lost, and people are only able to get around in large armed groups—if at all.\n\nCasualties are climbing by the day, and, should nothing be done about this calamity, the colony may be destroyed outright."
 gh_colonization_events.0005.a:90 "I can't do anything about this."
 gh_colonization_events.0005.a.tt:90 "[colonization_progress|E] decreases by #X 15#!"
 gh_colonization_events.0005.b:90 "A standing bounty on the monsters' heads should be enough."
 gh_colonization_events.0005.c:90 "My retinue will handle it."
 gh_colonization_events.0005.d:90 "[court_adventurer.GetFirstName] will deal with this."
 gh_colonization_events.0005.d.tt:90 "Your [GetCourtPositionType('court_adventurer_court_position').GetName()] dispatches the monsters without issue"

 gh_colonization_events.0006.t:90 "Colonization: Struck Gold!"
 gh_colonization_events.0006.desc:90 "What an auspicious day!\n\nThe surveyors in [colony.GetNameNoTier] have struck a massive gold vein, commencing the mining operations to fund the growth of the colony and, more importantly, to pay their tribute to me in advance. News of the discovery have already spread like a wildfire, leading to the scores of new settlers arriving in the province each week in a bid to build better lives for themselves."
 gh_colonization_events.0006.a:90 "Fantastic news!"
 gh_colonization_events.0006.b:90 "I will reinvest some of that gold back into the colony."

 gh_colonization_events.0007.t:90 "Colonization: Migrants from [migrant_origin.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]"
 gh_colonization_events.0007.desc:90 "I am receiving reports that my colony in [colony.GetNameNoTier] is experiencing an influx of new settlers of [migrant_origin.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetCulture.GetName] origin, who are headed there from the [migrant_origin.GetName] on the promise of a bright future away from their homeland.\n\nAlthough that future might admittedly be not as bright as they think, I have little doubt that they could be put to work to ensure the prosperity of the realm."
 gh_colonization_events.0007.a:90 "This is fine, I suppose."
 gh_colonization_events.0007.b:90 "More people means more taxes."
 gh_colonization_events.0007.b.tt:90 "[colonization_progress|E] in [colony.GetName] increases by #P 10#!"
 gh_colonization_events.0007.c:90 "They can settle [colony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] for me."
 gh_colonization_events.0007.c.tt:90 "[colonization_progress|E] increases by #P 30#!"

 gh_colonization_events.0008.t:90 "Colonization: Exceptional Harvest"
 gh_colonization_events.0008.desc:90 "An exceptionally good harvest has been reported in [colony.GetNameNoTier] this year, and the colony's granaries are filled to the brim with enough food for the settlers to feed themselves both this year and the next.\n\nAs their ruler and benefactor, I am naturally entitled to a portion of their produce, but extracting too much at once would run the risk of upsetting the region's economy and alienating its inhabitants."
 gh_colonization_events.0008.a:90 "Let them keep everything; I don't need it."
 gh_colonization_events.0008.b:90 "I'll claim a fifth of it for the good of the realm."
 gh_colonization_events.0008.c:90 "By right, it is all #EMP mine#!!"

 gh_colonization_events.0010.t:90 "Colonization: Silent Shores"
 gh_colonization_events.0010.desc:90 "The colony in [colony.GetNameNoTier] has gone silent.\n\nFirst, it was little things—a scouting party lost to the wilderness, some minor discrepancies in the local census, the odd family searching for their missing child. Then, a fishing vessel went missing. After that, a whole village. And now, not a single message has come from the settlement for over a month.\n\nSeveral vessels were dispatched to investigate the colony and have returned empty-handed, unable to spot even a glimpse of the outpost or its inhabitants. Indeed, even the coastline itself now seems alien and unfamiliar, as if the sheer cliffs of [eripomvuno_biozone|E] have rearranged themselves out of sight.\n\nWith no apparent leads, it seems that whatever became of the missing settlers shall remain a mystery."
 gh_colonization_events.0010.tt:90 "@death_icon! [dead_person.GetTitledFirstName] disappeared without a trace"
 gh_colonization_events.0010.a:90 "I can only pray for their souls."
