 narses.0001.desc:0 "It is done. Somehow, after the tragedy of Elysia, after so much was lost, I am victorious. The Sjalvolki barbarians have fled back to Kalathipsomi, and the lands lost during the war reclaimed by my forces, cheering my name as the saviour of [aversaria|E]. And it is not only in the northern, liberated lands that I am hailed.\n\nFor as I turn southwards, I see many of my rightful, yet rebellious subjects suddenly transformed into the picture of loyalty, falling over themselves to congratulate me on my great victory. Aautokratir, they call me, and they are right. My victory against the Witch-Breaker is clear proof that I alone am the rightful ruler of Aversaria! The only criticism I receive is that within myself, as a voice seems to warn me that this is not over. But with remnants of the Elysian Legions having sworn themselves to my service, when the hordes come pouring southward once more, I will stand as the shield of Aversaria, and bring victory once more!"
