 gh_belisarios_events.0001.desc:0 "For so long I have been focused upon revenge.  Like a hunger it consumed me.  Can one imagine the suffering — forced to go on with the knowledge that those who wronged me still lived, spreading their poison.  Laughing while my family rotted in the ground.  The injustice of it!  Even now, the thought alone is almost too much to bear.\n\nEnough of that.  It is finished.  My enemies are destroyed and I remain in their place.  There was nothing for me beyond revenge.  It had been my life for so long, my sole ambition.  My purpose.  I did not envision a future for myself.  In truth, I thought to be dead by now.  To be the final corpse on this bloody path I have carved.  Yet, despite it all, I live still.  Here, at the end, the world does not seem so empty.  Another sun rises and I feel its heat upon my face.  Perhaps it is time I started to live for myself.  I am more than my past."
