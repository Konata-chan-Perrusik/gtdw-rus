 gh_amsari.0001.vassals:89 "Qanamsar Pejman, is no more. In death, he has left behind an empire that once lay steady under his hand, now cast in the uncertainty of an era ending and another beginning. His heir, [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstName], has taken the throne, as Qanamsar Pejman intended. However, the Hiklahn is already divided in spirit, if not yet in blood.\n\nAmong the Qanamsar's kin, they plot and stir uneasily, ambition is as restless as a sword half-drawn. They all wait for their opportunity, alliances are forged in whispered oaths, old grievances fester anew. Soon the qanamsar will summon me to swear allegiance…"
 gh_amsari.0001.children:89 "My father has gone to his rest, leaving the Hiklahn and his title to [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstName]. I would honor his wishes if they felt just, but watching [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] on the throne does not sit easily with me. This was our father's world, one he held together with quiet strength. Yet who among us truly believes [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will hold it as he did? I see my siblings measure [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetHerHim] as I do — none of us blind to what that crown represents.\n\nMy father was a kind man, yes, but the legacy of past Qanamsars was built with blood. Perhaps mine will be, too."
 gh_amsari.0001.preferred_heir:89 "My father is gone, and I sit on the throne he kept secure for so long. I have watched, year after year, as he bound the Hiklahn together, saw how he held ambition and resentment at bay. Now that duty has passed to me, yet I know the years behind me far outnumber those ahead. The throne feels heavier than I imagined. I can feel the stirrings of those who share my blood.\n\nThe Hiklahn awaits my call to allegiance, but how many come willing, and how many with blades hidden beneath their cloaks? I wonder if my father ever felt this unease."
 gh_amsari.0001.independent_mahndayana_characters:89 "Qanamsar Pejman has passed, his throne now held by [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstName]. I owe nothing to this new Qanamsar by law, yet the passing of such a figure is felt even beyond the Hiklahn's borders. Pejman's strength was his ability to keep his kin bound to him, to keep his domain intact in troubled times.\n\nBut the future of the Hiklahn feels less certain now, with new ambitions rising and Pejman's gentle rule replaced by untested hands. I know the Hiklahn's fate could still ripple outward, and I wonder where that leaves us, the ones outside its reach."
 gh_amsari.0001.adventurers:89 "Qanamsar Pejman has passed, they say, and [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstName] has taken his place. Still, a shift in the throne is felt in many ways.

Though the ‘Qanamsar's Will' was never made known.\n\n[new_qanamsar.GetSheHe|U] has vowed to find and punish those responsible. Yet others suspect his hand in this death. [supposed_heir.GetFirstName], son of the fallen, has openly accused his uncle of treachery and rallied his forces in defiance.\n\nAcross the Hiklahn, noble kin scatter like leaves in a storm, each seeking refuge and calling in allies to support their claims. War seems inevitable, and none can say who will wear the crown when it ends."
 gh_amsari.0003.vassals_fallback:89 "Only days have passed since the new Qanamsar took the throne, and already the Hiklahn is spiraling into chaos. Rival claims have been raised in open defiance. Nobles scatter to their allies, rallying support for their own ambitions, war seems inevitable. Who will emerge as ruler when this storm has passed is uncertain."
 #Children
 gh_amsari.0003.children:89 "Our brother, [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstName], has been murdered, and before the ‘Qanamsar's Will' could be spoken, [new_qanamsar.GetFirstName] has claimed the throne, declaring it was [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetHerHis] wish. But we have seen ambition spark in [new_qanamsar.GetHerHis] eyes long before this day. While [new_qanamsar.GetSheHe] vows justice for our brother's death, whispers of treachery swirl, and [supposed_heir.GetFirstName] has already raised his banners against [new_qanamsar.GetHerHim], accusing [new_qanamsar.GetHerHim] of usurping his father's rightful place.\n\nThe Hiklahn fractures, and the blood of Qanamsars flows in all our veins. To step forward is to stake my own claim; to step back is to let others decide the realm's fate."
 gh_amsari.0003.children_fallback:89 "Pejman is gone, and the Hiklahn shudders under the weight of his absence. The new Qanamsar, [new_qanamsar.GetFirstName], has taken the throne, but already, others have raised their banners, each declaring themselves the rightful ruler, some calling him too weak to hold the old qanamsar's legacy. Allies are drawn like moths to flame, whispers of treachery and ambition now open cries for war.\n\nThe blood of Qanamsars flows in my veins. To step forward is to stake my own claim; to step back is to let others decide the realm's fate."
 #Supposed heir
 gh_amsari.0003.supposed_heir:89 "My father is dead, murdered! And before his body was even cold, my uncle, [new_qanamsar.GetFirstName], seized my throne, mine!\n\nThey wonder who could have killed him, yet do not question the man who walks in his blood, twisting my father's words to justify [new_qanamsar.GetHerHis] treachery. [new_qanamsar.GetSheHe|U] dares to claim this was my father's will, that [new_qanamsar.GetSheHe] was meant to rule in my place. Lies! I have seen [new_qanamsar.GetHerHis] ambition for years, as have those who served my father faithfully.\n\nNow, under the shadow of my father's death, [new_qanamsar.GetSheHe] makes [new_qanamsar.GetHerHis] move, cloaked in false loyalty.\n\nI will not let this insult stand. My father's blood cries out for justice, and I will see it done! If [new_qanamsar.GetFirstName] seeks the throne by deception, then let [new_qanamsar.GetHerHim] face me on the battlefield. The Hiklahn will know that the true heir has risen."
 #Current Qanamsar
 gh_amsari.0003.current_qanamsar:89 "My brother is gone, and I have taken the throne, just as he would have wanted, just as the Hiklahn demands. They whisper behind my back, no matters. Already, pretenders rise, [supposed_heir.GetFirstName] stirs rebellion, twisting the truth to claim the throne as his own.\n\nThey all gather their banners, the traitors! Whispering of their ‘rightful' claims, but I know the truth, they are nothing but scavengers circling the throne.\n\nI will show them the wrath of a true Qanamsar. The Hiklahn will not be torn apart by ambition and lies. Those who stand against me shall face my fury, and I will grind every pretender's hope into dust."
 gh_amsari.0003.current_qanamsar_fallback:89 "The throne is mine, and yet traitors circle me, claiming rights that are no more than shadows of ambition. Already, banners rise across the Hiklahn, pretenders whispering lies of their own ‘rightful' claims. But I am the Qanamsar, and I will see every last pretender crushed beneath the weight of my rule. None shall divide what is mine by right."
 #Independent Mahndayana rulers
 gh_amsari.0003.mahndayana_characters:89 "The Hiklahn roils in turmoil once more. Qanamsar [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstName] has been murdered, his life cut short before his rule even began. Now, his brother [new_qanamsar.GetFirstName] has claimed the throne, yet even from here, I hear the news of rival claims. Scarcely had [new_qanamsar.GetFirstName] taken the crown before pretenders emerged, banners raised across the land, each one calling for loyalty, each one claiming the throne as their own. Surely this will be over soon."
 gh_amsari.0003.mahndayana_characters_fallback:89 "The Hiklahn is once again thrown into turmoil. Barely has the new Qanamsar taken his place, and already rival claims have erupted, each faction gathering support in the hopes of claiming the throne. From here, the conflict seems a distant storm, but even so, its echoes reach our lands. Whether this war will end soon or tear the hiklahn apart, none can yet say."
 #Adventurers
 gh_amsari.0003.adventurers:89 "Rumors of blood and treachery fill the streets. They say Qanamsar [preferred_qanamsar_heir.GetFirstName] was murdered, and that his brother, [new_qanamsar.GetFirstName], now sits upon the throne. Yet there is talk of other claims, of banners rising all across the Hiklahn as pretenders and kin rally against one another. War has come to the hiklahn, and none can say who will hold the throne when the dust settles."
 gh_amsari.0003.adventurers_fallback:89 "The streets hum with rumors of bloodshed in the Hiklahn. They say the new Qanamsar's rule is already challenged, pretenders rising on every side. War is upon the hiklahn, with countless claims and loyalties dividing the realm. For those of us who watch from the outside, it's hard to tell who will emerge from this chaos."
 #Sarradon Characters
 gh_amsari.0003.sarradon_characters:89 "The fragile unity that was grafted together by Pejman has finally been brought to ruin by his death. Now his children and vassals all vie for the throne against one another.
