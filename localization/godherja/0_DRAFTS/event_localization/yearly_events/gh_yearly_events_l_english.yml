 marcher.1150.desc:0 "The villagers living in the vicinity of [province_being_affected.GetName] have come before me today as petitioners. It seems their herds have recently been victimized by an unusually aggressive griffon.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for wild griffons straying from their roosts in the Bastione Mountains to pick off one or two animals every year, the herdsmen report they've lost dozens of cattle in the span of two months. This behavior is highly unusual and merits investigation, if not for the mystery itself than at least to keep the peasants calm."

 marcher.1155.desc:0 "I've spent several days investigating the griffon terrorizing the villagers of [province_being_affected.GetName], and through process of elimination have managed to track it to a somewhat dilapidated corner of the county. Calling a meeting with my team, I settle on two options.\n\nNow that we know roughly where the animal is nesting we can investigate further to try and discover why the beast is acting so strangely and aggressively. Alternatively, we could lure it out with a steer as bait, and fight the animal yourself when it lands to take its prey."

 marcher.1160.desc:0 "Moving carefully at night around the vicinity of the griffon's nest I've been able to piece together enough clues to guess at its surprising origin. My best evidence was discovered where the beast seems to have pushed itself against a tree to get free of a tattered and bloodstained set of leather barding, and though the gear has been further worn by the weather for several months, the icons of an Anti-Magic Order were still clearly visible when I found them.\n\nThis would explain the beast's odd behavior: it's not a wild Bastione griffon at all, but instead a trained war-griffon. It's a common plot device in songs: a griffon so bonded to their knight that they are driven to grieving madness when their rider is slain by some cruel magi or lich. I always assumed that was just a bit of bardic embellishment, but now that I'm seeing it in person I have to admit the singers might not have been completely dishonest."

 marcher.1165.desc:0 "The mystery of the griffon's depredations become stranger as we carefully track its kills. While some of its prey are devoured then and there, every few strikes it takes the body of its bovine victim with it. At first I surmised it could have a nest with young until we noted a thin plume of smoke rising from the dense patch of forest to which it had returned. Griffons are smart animals, but they don't know how to light a fire.\n\nConfirming the beast has departed to hunt, I move quietly through the wilderness early the next afternoon. When I discover the encampment it does not come as a surprise, roughly a half dozen grizzled men and women, bandits by the looks of them. As I study the situation further the only warning I get that something's amiss is the sudden snap of a twig behind me. Stumbling backwards into the clearing I'm face to face with the gang's apparent leader, a terrifying looking woman wearing a tattered hauberk and a dirty tabard that still clearly bears the markings of one of the Anti-Magic orders. A renegade perhaps not unheard of, but unusual especially if she was trusted enough to be given a griffon. Desperately looking around I can see her men standing and readying their weapons."

 marcher.1170.t:0 "An Adventuresome Griffon"
 marcher.1170.desc:0 "My team and I are thorough in our search, but it turns out the mystery of the griffon terrorizing my province was, in the end, quite simple. Observing the majestic beast at rest from a hidden vantage point it's unmistakably a young male from one of the few remaining wild bloodlines - his drab, mottled gray coat and distinctively short and straight beak are traits which have been lost over the successive generations of breeding that resulted in the modern Marcher Griffon. While his decision to range so far from his breed's standard range in the Bastione Mountains is unusual, wild griffons are known to have a strong adventurous streak - a habit that makes them quite dangerous given that they lack none of the intelligence than their domesticated cousins are notorious for.\n\nWith that solved, now comes the harder question: how shall we deal with this noble beast."
 marcher.1170.a:0 "Oh just leave it be, he'll move on eventually."
 marcher.1170.b:0 "This will be dangerous, but I'm certain I can tame him!"
