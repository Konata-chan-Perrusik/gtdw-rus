 dead_magic.0001.t:0 "Man of Stone"
 dead_magic.0001.desc:0 "It has been suggested to me by my peers that I may find the practice of constructing a golem to be a valuable exercise in my skills. While the construction of a crude war-golem may be within my skills, building a more refined and specialized servant would be a true test of my skills, and undoubtedly teach me new aspects of the art.\n\nWith a table full of inked diagrams spread out before me, I ponder how I am to begin."
 dead_magic.0001.a:0 "Spare no expense, build me a golden golem!"
 dead_magic.0001.b:0 "Nothing flashy, just a straightforward servant."
 dead_magic.0001.c:0 "Can we just use tin?"
 dead_magic.0001.d:0 "On second thought, no."
 
 dead_magic.0002.t:0 "A Golem's Soul"
 dead_magic.0002.desc:0 "With the golem's body taking shape on my workbench, I am left to consider how best to fill its shell. A soul is required, and the nature of that soul will help shape my servant's function and skills. Thankfully there are no shortage of experts in soulcraft who can help acquire an appropriate spirit — for a price of course.\n\nThe choice is mine to make."
 dead_magic.0002.a:0 "The soul of a dutiful servant"
 dead_magic.0002.b:0 "The soul of a loyal bodyguard"
 dead_magic.0002.c:0 "The soul of a skilled dancer"
 dead_magic.0002.d:0 "Oh, just find a peasant."
 
 dead_magic.0003.t:0 "A Proposition"
 dead_magic.0003.desc:0 "A stranger has arrived at court, claiming to have heard of my ongoing quest to build a golem servant. They offer their services as a [magi|E] and experienced golem crafter, explaining that by certain arcane arts they can specialize my servant further.\n\nFor a price, of course."
 dead_magic.0003.a:0 "A shell of Orichalc, for unparalleled durability!" 
 dead_magic.0003.a.tt:0 "Will make the golem almost indestructable!"
 dead_magic.0003.b:0 "A second set of arms crafted from perfected Hermium!"
 dead_magic.0003.b.tt:0 "Will enhance the golem's utility as a servant!"
 dead_magic.0003.c:0 "Threading of perfected silver through the thing's cranium."
 dead_magic.0003.c.tt:0 "Will make the golem more perceptive and sharp!"
 dead_magic.0003.d:0 "No, we're fine."
 
 dead_magic.0004.t:0 "A New Hire?"
 dead_magic.0004.desc:0 "With the upgrades complete, the stranger is beginning to pack their bags and depart my court. [magi|E] with their skills are a rare find on Aeras. Perhaps I should entice them to remain here?"
 dead_magic.0004.a:0 "Wait, don't go! I have money!"
 dead_magic.0004.b:0 "No, we don't need them."
 
 dead_magic.0005.t:0 "A Golem Rises"
 dead_magic.0005.desc:0 "After long months of work, my golem is finally complete. Lying atop the granite slab, it slowly rises to a sitting position, then pulls itself upright. Crystalline eyes burn with an enigmatic green light as it studies its surroundings, before turning its attention towards me, its new master. It awaits my command."
 dead_magic.0005.a:0 "IT LIVES!"
 dead_magic.0005.b:0 "It lives!"
 dead_magic.0005.c:0 "Lovely. Sell it."
 
 dead_magic.0006.t:0 "Secrets of the Moonrocks"
 dead_magic.0006.desc:0 "‘There has to be a better way’ I mutter resigned, looking through the window at the night’s sky. It mocks me, [aervalr|E], its cracked corpse hanging high upon the firmament. It is late and I am locked in my study, surrounded by the musk of old, decayed paper. Grimoires and scrolls lie on the desk, subjects of my studies and the source of my frustration. Theorems on the art of [dead_magic|E], once precious, now useless. Outdated. Unreliable at best, now that the Aervalr is broken.\n\n‘There has to be.’ I repeat as a smudge crosses the black sky, the path of yet another shard falling. Of course! I’ve been looking at it wrong. The texts are useless, for we don’t have the moon of their times. But we do have something else, something much closer. Its broken shards, the moonrock fallen upon [aeras|E]. If I were to procure some samples, if I were to study them… What knowledge might I glean?" 
 dead_magic.0006.a:0 "There is a site in my realm where moonrocks have fallen."
 dead_magic.0006.b:0 "I will need to purchase them first, of course."
 dead_magic.0006.c:0 "Study rocks? Surely I’ve got better things to do."
 
 dead_magic.0007.t:0 "The Rocks Arrive"
 dead_magic.0007.desc:0 "My servants bring in the chest. A soft, green glow leaks from its form, barely visible in the torchlight filling my study. They move swiftly, the nervousness clear on their faces as they drop it down, barely stopping themselves from jumping away. In the preceding days rumours spread through the castle, tall tales of the dead fields surrounding the fallen shards and the sickness that spreads through those unfortunate enough to mine them. While surely exaggerated, there may be a merit to them. Even as I stand there I can feel the power from within the locked chest. A shiver runs down my spine. Fear? Anticipation? Either way, I will have to be careful as I proceed with my studies."
 dead_magic.0007.a:0 "Let’s begin."
 dead_magic.0007.a.failure.t:0 "You fail to gain insight from the rocks"
 dead_magic.0007.a.success.t:0 "You gain valuable insight from the rocks"
 dead_magic.0007.b:0 "My court Magi, [court_magi.GetTitledFirstName], might be of use here."
 dead_magic.0007.c:0 "Actually, I’ve changed my mind. Get rid of this junk."
