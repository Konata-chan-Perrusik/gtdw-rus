 mixed_magic_mind.0011.desc:0 "My courtier, [dreamer.GetName], has been sleepwalking in the middle of the night, speaking erratically and acting out [dreamer.GetHerHis] terrible nightmares. [dreamer.GetHerHis|U] dreams speak of powerful rituals and beings beyond my comprehension, and a constant undercurrent of magic flows out as [dreamer.GetSheHe] sleepwalks. However, when they wake they seem perfectly normal. They beg me to heal them, but I run the risk of making their nightmares even worse. Alternatively, what they dream could be studied intensely and tapping into their mind as they walk would give me great insight into the study of Mixed Magic.\n\nAlthough, if they somehow fell asleep permanently, their dreams would be a powerful source of magic…"
