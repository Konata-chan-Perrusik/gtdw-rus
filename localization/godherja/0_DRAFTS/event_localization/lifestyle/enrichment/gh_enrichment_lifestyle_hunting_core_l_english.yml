I take first watch through the night, staring at our campfire as it turns to a handful of dying embers. As I lay there, listening to the fire's crackle, a soft bubbling begins to rise from the edge of the pond. In a panic, I quickly rise, readying my weapon. The moonlight does not penetrate the surface of the water, but I notice it bubbling and splashing into the soil. My companions have not noticed in their slumber, and I slowly step closer to the water. Strangely, I feel almost drawn to it. Bubbles and foam give way to nostrils and eyelids, lips and cheekbones - a face in the water.\n\nIts skin seems almost translucent, and the soft light of the night sky makes it glow in the water. I cannot help but stumble backwards at the sight, and am unable to grip my weapon as I shake uncontrollably. The milky eyelids snap open, and the pale, white irises of this face stare deep into mine, as if searching for something within. Its lips curl into a half smile.

They're harsher, angrier than when I first looked upon them.\n\nMore memories fly across my eyes, the things I have done to get me to where I am today. The tendrils suddenly tighten around me, yanking me hard to the ground as those swirling on my chest pierce between my ribcage.

 sjalvolki_hunt.7028.desc:0 "Every so often, I notice what seems to be a humanoid silhouette in the corners of my vision, standing just at the edge of the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E]'s visibility —or I think I do, at least. Whenever I turn to look at it, there's either nothing there, or the shadow turns out to be that of a dead tree or other natural formation.\n\nThe first few times I could chalk it up to mere tricks of the mind, but that explanation has grown increasingly less comforting as the thing continues to appear, and the feeling of being watched becomes even more intense than normal. It doesn't help that none of my party members seem to be having the same experience."

 sjalvolki_hunt.7029.desc:0 "Just around the massive redwood trunk ahead of us, where the trail of our prey leads, a colossal beehive hangs from the side of the bark. A faint, deep buzz echoes through the forest around us as we crouch low to the ground, careful to avoid making any noise lest we wake the hive.\n\nWhile we could sneak quietly through until we're far enough away to avoid their ire, the honey of the Waking Coast is said to be an exceptional delicacy, and we could always use more food."
 sjalvolki_hunt.7029.a:0 "We'll need to take each step with caution."
