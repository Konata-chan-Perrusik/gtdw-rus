 aironoiakaan.0001.desc:0 "The trek through the rugged canyons was difficult and perilous, the winding trail was labyrinthine and treacherous, and there is every chance that bandits or monsters would emerge from the canyon walls. Eventually, the trail opened up to reveal my destination - the Mayikprolollan Aironoiakaan, premiere center of magic and learning in Aironoi. As I step through the threshold, I am greeted by a wondrous sight: an ornate structure surrounded by shimmering walls adorned with gems and glowing runes, the sky humming with power and full of [magi|E] travelling to and fro, and in the distance, the famed Tower of Stars stands resplendent.\n\nInside, I am greeted by a wizened Magi, who, preternaturally already aware of my purpose, presented me with several dossiers. 'These are the most outstanding Magi of the year' he said, 'You can be rest assured that the skill of these spellcasters far eclipse even those from Kashirya or the West.'"
