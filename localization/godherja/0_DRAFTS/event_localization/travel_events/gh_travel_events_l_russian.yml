 gh_travel_event.1001.desc:0 "Our party stops for the evening at a small town, and quickly make ourselves at home in the local traveler's inn. It's a somewhat rustic affair, more of a converted barn really, but it'll do. The locals are friendly enough, and the town is well enough stocked that they're willing to sell beer and food even if the prices are somewhat suspiciously high. Regardless, it doesn't take long for my party to begin feeling the cheer. I suppose I could take this moment as an opportunity to encourage them further by delivering a heroic speech."

 gh_travel_event.1002.desc:0 "Days of torrential rain has led to a near disaster. The river ahead, glutted with water, has overflown its banks and made the ford on our maps impassible. Gathering on the muddy bank my party and I survey the situation with grim determination. If we are to press on, a few options present themselves. Boats could be commandeered from a nearby village for a small cost. We could attempt to swim the glutted river - surely a hazardous proposition. Or we could just wait for the flood waters to to ebb, though it would risk the trail going cold."

Just as I'm thinking of ordering us to set up camp, one of the scouts I sent ahead returns, excitedly crashing through the underbrush and bounding into the clearing in which we are gathered. "A ruin! It's too decrepit to tell who may have built it, and a bit out of the way. While it will take some climbing to reach, there could be treasure buried within!" I can see the avarice in my men's eyes at just the thought. Though, if we do pursue this 'treasure' - should it exist, we do risk losing the trail."

Staring at me from the corner of my eyes. Once I turn my head, it's gone, but the feeling remains. It's getting harder to sleep. I have woken in a fright almost every morning since. And even when I tell others of what lurks in my shadows, they simply look worried or fearful. It's all in my head, they say. Well, we shall see about that."

 gh_travel_event.1009.desc:0 "Much of our journey today has been solitary, with little to draw our attention beyond the path ahead. That is, until we stumbled into a small party of Sjalvolki hunters scouting the area ahead. Both of our groups were taken aback, none of us expecting to meet anyone else out in the wilds. One among them, most likely their leader, steps forward to face us, and challenges the leader of our group to hunting rights here. It's clear that we were both following the same tracks, and these hunters do not seem keen on sharing the spoils of their hunt.\n\nIf I manage to win, they will honor the bargain and leave, though if I lose we would be expected to do the same. Declining the duel would be the same as losing in their eyes, so we have little options before us."

Step after step, march after march, we've trudged along in seek of our quarry with no sign of stopping.\n\nSuddenly the overwhelming aroma of death and decay fill my nostrils, and I start to gag. My companions are similar, and as we explore our surroundings to determine the smell's source, we discover a most devastating scene. The remnants of a battlefield lay before us, fetted and rancid, thick with rot and bile as if flooded with it. No doubt, corpse eaters skulk through the muck, but if it hasn't been picked clean, there's most likely treasures still here. If we're quick enough, we could find something worth while, though it will be incredibly dangerous."

They look ancient and weathered, and upon closer inspection their engravings are completely indechiperable, beyond perhaps, that these stones were a family. It's impossible to tell how old the stones, nor who is truly buried here, but nonetheless a quiet stillness hangs in the air above us."

Someone's stomach amongst us growls, and the kind villagers offer to sell some of their food to us."

With night setting in, we manage to find a pond to claim fresh water from, and set up camp for the night. We'll need luck on our side if we hope to find our bearings tomorrow.. I take first watch through the night, staring at our campfire as it turns to a handful of dying embers. As I lay there, listening to the fire's crackle, a soft bubbling begins to rise from the edge of the pond. In a panic, I quickly rise, readying my weapon. The moonlight does not penetrate the surface of the water, but I notice it bubbling and splashing into the soil. My companions have not noticed in their slumber, and I slowly step closer to the water. Strangely, I feel almost drawn to it. Bubbles and foam give way to nostrils and eyelids, lips and cheekbones - a face in the water.\n\nIts skin seems almost translucent, and the soft light of the night sky makes it glow in the water. I cannot help but stumble backwards at the sight, and am unable to grip my weapon as I shake uncontrollably. The milky eyelids snap open, and the pale, white irises of this face stare deep into mine, as if searching for something within. Its lips curl into a half smile. If I take my chances, I could still flee before anything happens, but who knows what this is? I may never encounter a being like this again..."

 gh_travel_event.1015.desc:0 "I steady my breathing as I look back into the face's eyes, and stand up from the dirt with what confidence I can muster. Wispy tendrils of fog spew from its mouth, snaking across the water's surface towards my feet. I start to step away as they come closer, but decide against it, leaving myself at the mercy of the unknowable. As the wisps touch my skin, a cold breeze rushes across me, as if I were taken into the watery depths. Images of my life flash before me- moments of selfishness, violence, lust, and greed. Some I hardly recognize, others burn in my chest as if coals were left within me. The tendrils snake further up my body, reaching to my chest where they spiral over my heart. I look down at them, an endless encirclement spinning deeper and deeper into my chest, and back at the pale eyes in the water. They're harsher, angrier than when I first looked upon them.\n\nMore memories fly across my eyes, the things I have done to get me to where I am today. The tendrils suddenly tighten around me, yanking me hard to the ground as those swirling on my chest pierce between my ribcage. I try to scream in pain, but no sound escapes my lips as I'm dragged into the water. I can only watch my companion's sleeping forms as images of blood and depravity fill my mind to the seams, and the sharpened mist reaches into my heart. I will not feel remorse for all that I have done, but the spirit that's pulled into its watery depths seems intent on making me experience hell. Now fully submerged beneath the surface, I see what lurks beneath the depths—a mound of bones.\n\nAnd I am to join them."

The tendrils snake further up my body, reaching to my chest where they spiral over my heart. I look down at them, an endless encirclement spinning deeper and deeper into my chest, though I feel no pain nor malice. I look back to the pale eyes, softer and lighter than they were before, almost welcoming with familiarity. More memories fly across my eyes, as if pulled along a road by the tendrils.\n\nAlmost as quickly as it had begun, the tendrils dissipate into mist around me, and when I look back to the water, the face is gone. In its place, sitting just atop the water's surface, a gem. It glows with iridescence, beautiful in its shimmering. I wade through the water towards it, and take it into my hand. It feels soft, yet harder than iron somehow, and fills me with what I can only describe as the warmth of a hearth at home. The once icy water feels almost tranquil with the gem in my hand, and as I climb from its depths back to the fire, I cannot help but wonder what decided to bless me so.

There is no way to fight something like this, at least not one that I know, and it does not take long for my companions' screeches and the stamping of hooves to catch up to me as we flee through the steppe.

We rush toward the cry's source and find a large, jagged hole leading deep beneath the ground's surface. A small river floods into it from the mud underfoot, and through the dark I can barely see the outline of my companion down below, and they seem no worse for wear.\n\nIf we are to escape this storm we will need to climb down as well, but we must have caution not to slip and fall in like the other."

Peering over the edge of the cracked cliffside deeper into the cave, I toss a torch to watch how far it falls.

Their scattered bones form a clear, if winding, path forward.\n\nFor a time, we walk in silence, while the skeletons multiply in number. Just as I can no longer avoid stepping on crunching bone, another doorway emerges into my view—with one last body lying just a hair's breadth from the threshold. Stepping into the small room beyond, claustrophobic after the previous chamber's expanse, we find nothing of note—save for another doorway on the far end, somehow leading straight back to the entrance."
