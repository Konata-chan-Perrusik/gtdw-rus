 marcher_lich.0001.desc: "I received word today that a [Concept('liches','Lich')|E] has recently raided the area of [county_raided_by_lich.GetName], burning down several towns and capturing dozens of innocents to drag back for their uses in the [the_lichdoms|E]. The province is devastated, and the string of fortifications along it were burned attempting to hold off the attack.\n\nThe Lich, or at least their forces, is gone now. But the ruins remain."

 marcher_lich.1001.desc: "Within the jagged, wrought metal walls of the Necropolis, it felt as if death hung over our party. The air was still and ancient, unbreathed for generations, and behind every inexplicably shadowed doorway lay untold treasures ripe for the taking.\n\nYet somewhere within these halls, the [Concept('liches','Lich')|E] still stirred, and unless we acted fast will likely escape our grasp."
 marcher_lich.1001.a: "Wait, I will fight it myself!"
 marcher_lich.1001.b: "[great_champion.GetName] should have this fight!"
 marcher_lich.1001.c: "[great_magi.GetName] will make short work of this."

 arch_lich_invasion.0005.t: "Death Stirs"
 arch_lich_invasion.0005.desc: "Somewhere to the far [Concept('the_lichdoms','north')|E] I can feel a poisonous power stirring. It has grown stronger and recent days, and tugs at something deep in my heart.\n\nI know not what presence is behind this, but I am sure we will know soon enough."
 arch_lich_invasion.0005.a: "I wish we would not have to."


arch_lich_invasion.0007.t: "Black Horizons"
arch_lich_invasion.0007.desc: "All across [chevalie|E], from peasant to king and all who lumber the hours between, a shadow hangs above their heads.\n\nThe northern [Concept('the_lichdoms','shadow')|E] has wrenched a tendril out toward the land of the living, almost as if in accusation. Most do not understand the signs, or are too young to remember them, but those that do know it all too well—\n\nThe dead are coming."

The black clouds on the horizon grow ever stronger, and can known what horrors this '[arch_lich.GetShortUINameNoTooltip]' may yet bring down on us."
arch_lich_invasion.1001.far: "Rumors have begun trickling out of [chevalie|E], along with a number of fearful merchants, that some powerful [Concept('liches','Magi')|E] has come back from the dead to haunt the living. It's impossible to say whether the rumors are true, but there's no way to be for sure. Yet."
arch_lich_invasion.1001.craven: "Just the thought of it sends a shiver down my spine!"
arch_lich_invasion.1001.a: "They won't even make it past the Blackforts."
arch_lich_invasion.1001.b: "When will those Marchers learn to stop it with their tall tales..."

arch_lich_invasion.1003.desc: "At last, the [arch_lich|E] has met defeat here in the land of [kingdom_target.GetNameNoTier]. Untold numbers of dead lie in its wake both fresh and pulled from their graves for this foul march. Already, the Lich flees back to the safety of [Concept('the_lichdoms','dead land')|E], but we have it on the run.\n\n#N The Arch-Lich will return unless dealt with in its Necropolis.#!"

arch_lich_invasion.1005.desc: "At long the last, the vile [defeated_arch_lich.GetFirstName] has been defeated.\n\nAlready, the undead hordes under its command collapse in piles, and the minor Liches who followed its command flee for the far [Concept('the_lichdoms','north')|E] as fast as the wind will take them. Who knows how long it will take to recover from this nightmare, but at last,\n\ndawn is breaking."
 arch_lich_invasion.1005.a: "May the next day be a brighter one."

Life itselfs seem to be on the brink of collapse, as [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] unleashes its horrors on the land.\n\nThis nightmare threatens us all, but are we willing to risk everything for the sake of others?"

 arch_lich_invasion.4001.t: "The Fall of Chevalie"
 arch_lich_invasion.4001.desc: "Chevalie is gone.\n\nNone thought it possible, the land of Anti-Magic arts and countless stories of great knights triumphing over the vile magics of the dead, yet now the land lay silent and burning.\n\nRefugees have poured out of the north for days, and what few [antimagic_orders|E] survived have tried to reconstitute some form of resistance from [the_isles|E] in hopes of driving the [arch_lich|E] back, but the once vibrant shores of Chevalie have turned black with death."
 arch_lich_invasion.4001.a: "Is this how the world ends?"

 arch_lich_invasion.4002.desc: "The Forests of Kalathipsomi are gone.\n\n The undead scoure of the [arch_lich|E] have turned the once lush and ancient forests of Kalathipsomi into a toxic tar pit of death unsuitable for even the strongest of life. The trickle of survivors has long since stopped, and no one knows anymore what lurks on the frontier of life.\n\nSailors on [the_isles|E] say it's not safe to go north any more, the waters of the Aloysian Sea having turned against them. Yet the [arch_list.GetFirstName] marches on, spreading death with its every step."
 arch_lich_invasion.4002.a: "They must be stopped."

 arch_lich_invasion.4010.t: "Raocourt's Secret"
 arch_lich_invasion.4010.desc: "The [arch_lich|E] [arch_lich.GetFirstName] managed to break far enough into [chevalie|E] that its horde reached the sanctified halls of Raocourt. Only scant rumors tell of what happened, and none are brave enough to believe it, but Lich is said to have traveled far below the city and cracked into what must be an ancient catacomb of the dead. A whole city of corpses, just below our feet. Who knows how many are down there, but if the story's true, the Lich has likely taken them all for its army."
 arch_lich_invasion.4010.a: "This is very concerning..."

 arch_lich_invasion.4011.t: "The Dragon's Undeath"
 arch_lich_invasion.4011.desc: "The story sounded impossible at first. A roar unlike any other, heard far and wide across [Concept('etepezea_biozone','Etepezea')|E], and the skeletal monstrosity of a [dragon|E] brought back from the dead.\n\nYet the stories persist. Now, all across the land are terrified of these nightmares flying through the sky, spewing cold-fire from farmland to city and everything in-between.\n\nNone have uncovered a way to kill them quickly, but if we do not act fast this may be the greatest danger Humanity has ever faced."
 arch_lich_invasion.4011.a: "We must do something, fast!"

 arch_lich_invasion.4012.t: "The World-Eater, Returned"

 arch_lich_invasion.4012.a: "Death comes for us all."
