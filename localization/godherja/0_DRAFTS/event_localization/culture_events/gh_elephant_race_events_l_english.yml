 elephant_race.0001.t:0 "The Games Begin"
 elephant_race.0001.desc:0 "I have arrived at the racing grounds to see a field of merriment matched in few other places. Markets, arenas, the massive tracks... it is a spectacle indeed. Poor musicians ply their trade to prince and pauper alike, and all but the most grievous of sins is forgotten and forgiven. Here, at the elephant races, Kashirya unites as one to revel for days on end."
 elephant_race.0001.a:0 "Let's see what I can find..."
 elephant_race.0001.b:0 "Actually, I find myself uninterested"

 elephant_race.1001.t:0 "A Merchant's Offer"
 elephant_race.1001.desc:0 "As I pass through a series of tents on my way to my lodgings, a merchant in garish colors attracts my eye.\n\n"Ah, come here, my friend. Surely a fine [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] such as yourself is in need of charms to match?"\n\nThe trinkets [trinket_merchant.GetSheHe] presents are not to be balked at, but they are far from reasonably priced."
 elephant_race.1001.a:0 ""You have yourself a deal""
 elephant_race.1001.b:0 "Time to test my haggling..."
 elephant_race.1001.b.success:0 "The merchant accepts your plea to lower the price"
 elephant_race.1001.b.success.t:0 "You lower the price successfully"
 elephant_race.1001.b.failure:0 "The merchant sees through your attempts and outwits you"
 elephant_race.1001.b.failure.t:0 "The merchant outwits you"
 elephant_race.1001.b.tt:0 "You haggle with the merchant"
 elephant_race.1001.c:0 ""I think not""

 elephant_race.1002.t:0 "A Sweet Exchange?"
 elephant_race.1002.desc:0 "On the way to my lodgings for the evening, I collide with a serving [servant.GetWomanMan]. Muttering profanities softly onto the wind, [servant.GetSheHe] helps me to my feet and bows before me.\n\n"Forgive me, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I was in a rush. Might I offer you a local delicacy as recompense? They are unmatched."\n\nAs I turn my head, [servant.GetSheHe] looks more than bashful after seeing my dusty attire. As the night has begun to fall, however, I realise that they fear my wrath more than any shame."
 elephant_race.1002.a:0 ""That sounds delightful""
 elephant_race.1002.b:0 ""Be on your way, [servant.GetWomanMan]. I have no time for this""
 elephant_race.1002.c:0 ""I'll have your hide!""
 elephant_race.1002.d:0 ""Is this... shrimp? I have already eaten too many shrimp!""

 elephant_race.1003.t:0 "Wrestling a Prize"
 elephant_race.1003.desc:0 "A great arena on the edges of the camp has drawn all manner of patrons over. Within, a series of wrestling matches has been occurring, and I can no longer stand to ignore them. As I enter, I am greeted by the sight of a burly master of the ancient arts, calling up to the crowd as though he were their lord.\n\n"Any man or woman foolish enough to face me still? No?"\n\nThis wrestler is a capable fighter, of that I am sure, but his arrogance is clear. Perhaps he is in need of training?"
 elephant_race.1003.a:0 ""You need a lesson in humility!""
 elephant_race.1003.a.success:0 "You beat the arrogant wrestler into submission"
 elephant_race.1003.a.failure:0 "The wrestler humiliates you"
 elephant_race.1003.b:0 ""How would you like a place in my household?""
 elephant_race.1003.b.success:0 "The wrestler agrees to join your household"
 elephant_race.1003.b.success.t:0 "The wrestler joins you"
 elephant_race.1003.b.failure:0 "The wrestler laughs off your offer of allegiance"
 elephant_race.1003.b.failure.t:0 "The wrestler refuses"
 elephant_race.1003.c:0 "Whatever happened to this ancient sport..."

 elephant_race.1004.t:0 "Revelers Galore"
 elephant_race.1004.desc:0 "Taking a stroll through the racing grounds at night, I stumble across a gaggle of drunkards frolicking amongst a series of haphazard tents. Their clothes are sodden and their smiles are crooked. The stench of alcohol and all manner of bizarre foods is inescapable.\n\n"You there! You looking for a drink or what?" Their leader sways toward me as [drunkard.GetSheHe] slurs [drunkard.GetHerHis] words. "There's always room for another!""
 elephant_race.1004.a:0 ""What's the harm in one drink?""
 elephant_race.1004.b:0 ""You had me at 'drink,' my friend""
 elephant_race.1004.c:0 "Why bother with drunks? I keep walking"

 elephant_race.1005.t:0 "A Pompous Patron"
 elephant_race.1005.desc:0 "On my way to the racing grounds, I am nearly toppled by the swinging limbs of a particularly loquacious patron.\n\n"Watch where you step, [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]! Where do you think we are?"\n\nThe patron is dressed particularly richly, but [patron.GetHerHis] manners are far from abundant as [patron.GetSheHe] regards you with scorn. There is a challenge to those words."
 elephant_race.1005.a:0 ""Watch your tongue""
 elephant_race.1005.a.success:0 "The patron backs away from you carefully"
 elephant_race.1005.a.success.t:0 "You cow the patron"
 elephant_race.1005.a.failure:0 "The patron laughs in your face and moves on"
 elephant_race.1005.a.failure.t:0 "The patron is unmoved"
 elephant_race.1005.b:0 "I take myself away from [patron.GetHerHis] presence quickly"
 elephant_race.1005.c:0 ""By your presence, I would assume we are in the southward end of a northbound cow""

 elephant_race.2001.t:0 "Idle Whispers"
 elephant_race.2001.desc:0 "As I sit myself on a bench in the racing ground, I notice a couple of cloaked strangers shuffle their way behind me. They speak in hushed tones, like parents wishing to leaving their baby's sleep undisturbed. Whatever they have come to the elephant races for, it is not to place a bet on the returning champion.\n\nIf I was to adjust my posture, I might be able to catch the topic of their discussion. It might be a secret worth knowing."
 elephant_race.2001.a:0 "I lean back and attempt to gage their words."
 elephant_race.2001.a.success:0 "You learn of a new [secret|E] from the strangers"
 elephant_race.2001.a.success.t:0 "You learn of a new [secret|E]"
 elephant_race.2001.a.failure:0 "The men quiet suddenly, noticing you"
 elephant_race.2001.a.failure.t:0 "You hear nothing"
 elephant_race.2001.b:0 "The reward is not worth the risk"

 elephant_race.2002.t:0 "A Cruel Game"
 elephant_race.2002.desc:0 "When the early races begin, I notice a strange sight behind the stands. A trainer seems to be jabbing at one of the elephants with a spear, a smile on their face. The creature has not been called to the track, and I wonder the purpose of such cruelty.\n\nThe trainer seems to spot me amongst the crowd, and a dark look overtakes them. They must expect some sort of response."
 elephant_race.2002.a:0 "A wave is all that is needed. Who cares about one elephant?"
 elephant_race.2002.b:0 "I must stop this brutality!"
 elephant_race.2002.b.success:0 "The trainer is restrained by you and sent to be punished by the authorities"
 elephant_race.2002.b.success.t:0 "You stop the cruelty"
 elephant_race.2002.b.failure:0 "The trainer escapes, leaving you to be blamed for the pained cries of the elephant"
 elephant_race.2002.b.failure.t:0 "The trainer escapes"

 elephant_race.2003.t:0 "An Accidental Show"
 elephant_race.2003.desc:0 "As the early races begin, I take my place to observe a relative newcomer. The elephants are brought to their starting lines by dedicated trainers. I am not close enough to the front to see much of the men around the beast, but the crowd begins to chatter nervously. Something is amiss, I know it in my heart, and I feel compelled to stand.\n\nThat is when the trainer is coated in a river of dung from above.\n\nThe crowd erupt into a fit of laughter as the trainer slips over into the mess. There is no escaping the sight of the humiliation."
 elephant_race.2003.a:0 "What a spectacle! What a show! Ha!"
 elephant_race.2003.b:0 "It is hardly worth chuckling over"

 elephant_race.3001.t:0 "The Racer's Dilemma"
 elephant_race.3001.desc:0 "The time of the grand final fast approaches. There are many elephants that still can take the crown and win their patrons a purse, but only two stand out to my eye. First, the former champion of many local affairs, said to be unbeatable in any race it competes in. The other is a new entry to the sport, but it has already accrued a reputation of speed and skill.\n\nThe choice of which to bet my money on is no easy task, but the game does not come without risk."
 elephant_race.3001.a:0 "The defending beast will win again, I know it"
 elephant_race.3001.b:0 "The stranger to these games will be a champion soon enough"
 elephant_race.3001.c:0 "I do not enjoy risks. How about a few... tweaks to the contest?"

 elephant_race.3002.t:0 "The Champion Prevails!"
 elephant_race.3002.desc:0 "The race is an intense one. The champion makes a slow start, unable to match the early pace of its new rival. My heart races with the thumping feet of the elephants, and I find myself incapable of tearing my eyes away. The champion grows closer and closer to the finish line, always second, never faltering. As the end draws near, the defending champion shows its caliber.\n\nBy a trunk, my elephant has won the day.\n\nI let out a cheer, as do many on the benches around me. I made the right call! It is hard to hide my joy at the news."
 elephant_race.3002.a:0 "I am victorious!"

 elephant_race.3003.t:0 "A New Champion"
 elephant_race.3003.desc:0 "The champion bolts off with surprising confidence. Leading the pack so early is always a sure sign of victory, if I know the game at all. My eyes are stuck on the scene, feeling every footstep vibrate through me. The winner seems clear, and yet the defending champion's footing seems to grow unsteady.\n\nWith the trip of its feet, my creature has failed.\n\nI let out a deflated sigh. It seems that I have lost my bet because my beast couldn't run straight. What a waste of good coin..."
 elephant_race.3003.a:0 "A shame, really"
 elephant_race.3003.b:0 ""I demand recompense! What sort of joke is this?""

 elephant_race.3004.t:0 "A Challenger No More!"
 elephant_race.3004.desc:0 "The champion bolts off with surprising confidence. Leading the pack so early is always a sure sign of victory, if I know the game at all. My eyes are stuck on the scene, feeling every footstep vibrate through me. The winner seems clear, and yet the defending champion's footing seems to grow unsteady.\n\nWith the trip of its rival's feet, my creature takes the victory.\n\nI let out a cry of triumph and stand to revel in my elephant's success. I am rich!"
 elephant_race.3004.a:0 "A wise bet, if I say so myself!"

 elephant_race.3005.t:0 "The Home Advantage"
 elephant_race.3005.desc:0 "The race is an intense one. The champion makes a slow start, unable to match the early pace of its new rival. My heart races with the thumping feet of the elephants, and I find myself incapable of tearing my eyes away. The champion grows closer and closer to the finish line, always second, never faltering. As the end draws near, the defending champion shows its caliber.\n\nBy a trunk, my elephant has lost the day.\n\nI let out a deflated sigh. It seems that I have lost my bet because of my elephant's laziness. What a waste of good coin..."
 elephant_race.3005.a:0 "I suppose there is always next year"
 elephant_race.3005.b:0 ""What sort of beast wastes such an advantage? Give me its head!""

 elephant_race.3006.t:0 "A Race Against Time"
 elephant_race.3006.desc:0 "The champion has decided not to defend its title, having caught itself a nasty case of 'knife-in-the-foot' only hours before the race. I watch as my elephant easily outruns the weakened competition, and yet a couple seem to be putting up a fight. I wave my hand, and these would-be champions fall over obstacles that should not have been allowed to grace the track. By the end, there is only my beast to claim victory over the debacle.\n\nAlthough I always knew that this would be the outcome, I cannot help but smile at my fortune."
 elephant_race.3006.a:0 "Let the crowd call it a charlatan's game. I am not the one with empty pockets"

 elephant_race.3007.t:0 "The Tricks of the Game"
 elephant_race.3007.desc:0 "The returning champion has somehow managed to compete after it was diagnosed with a late case of 'knife-in-the-foot,' much to my surprise. As the race begins, it takes an early lead and puts my own creature to shame. My heart in my mouth, I wave to a few friends that I have gathered to observe the spectacle. Obstacles fill the track, and yet, by some miracle, the elephants manage to avoid the debris.\n\nAll bar one. My elephant.\n\nThe scowl on my face is hard to conceal. This was not supposed to happen. This was meant to be my day of victory."
 elephant_race.3007.a:0 "It seems that skulduggery pays little here"

 elephant_race.9001.t:0 "A Victorious Showing"
 elephant_race.9001.desc:0 "These races have been as rewarding as I had hoped. I have made my fair share of winnings from my labors, and now I can return home a better, and richer, [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] for them. Kashirya will not forget these days, I hope, because they have been a spectacle to remember. I am a true elephant racer for all the world to see. Who can doubt my knowledge now?"
 elephant_race.9001.a:0 "Time to return home"

 elephant_race.9002.t:0 "A Return from Racing"
 elephant_race.9002.desc:0 "These races have been a joke and I have come out of them no better than when I entered. If Kashirya remembers these games, it will not be for any deed of mine. The triumph belongs to others, and I am left to travel back home with my head held low. Perhaps I will have my owed victory at the next games, but that is another race altogher."
 elephant_race.9002.a:0 "Time to leave the races behind"
