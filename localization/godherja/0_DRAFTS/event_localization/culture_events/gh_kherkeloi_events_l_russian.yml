 kherkeloi.0001.desc:0 "Not since [ertomax|E] has the Aruvasuen sun shone so brightly above the lands of the faithful. My name has become synonymous with the restoration of my people to a place not experienced since the [aironoian_migration|E] expelled our people from our own lands.\n\nNow, I have granted my people return to their kingdom, and the Hand of Aruvas guards us once more. My name is legend, and no [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] or Öltenic barbarian will take our home again. With my feat, the halls ring out with my name as we dance and kill and feast our way across Aironoi once again."

 kherkeloi.0002.desc:0 "The lands of the Aruvasue, long since disunited and forgotten, now roar with the sound of a thousand feasts. A successor to [ertomax|E] has arisen, one who claims to be able to restore the ancient traditions of the Aryvann Vos.\n\nWhilst their intentions are unclear, many fear the return of the ancient kingdom will bring back the ancient wars that plagued the east of Aironoi until the [bayyuralar|E]. There is hope that peace might stay, but with the return of his kingdom, there is no certainty that another Ertomax might arise to rule it and bathe Aironoi in blood."
