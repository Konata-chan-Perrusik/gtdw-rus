Now, they are silent, their roots charred and their idols toppled.\n\nFrom the ashes of their destruction, the Priesthood of the Eternal Flame has risen anew, a beacon of enlightenment and industry that outshines the dim flicker of nature's primitive ways. The fires of Korlacu, unyielding and eternal, burn brighter than ever, forging a path for civilization to march forward.\n\nAcross the lands, bells toll in celebration of this victory.

Civilization reigns supreme, its light chasing away the shadows of heresy."
