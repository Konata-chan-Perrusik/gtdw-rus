 gh_olteni_events.0101.desc:0 "I have been informed that a wandering Ölteni elder—#EMP Tönnm Öngot#!—was spotted travelling through my realm, bestowing blessings in villages and tending to the sick.\n\nAn appearance of one is rare, and it is customary to extend them an offer of hospitality in exchange for their wisdom.\n\nThat is, only if they appear at one's very doorstep..."
 gh_olteni_events.0101.a:0 "I shall welcome them in my [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]."

Dozens of small bells are sewn into [elder.GetHerHis] robes, accentuating each movement with soft melodic chimes.\n\n"My name is [elder.GetName], Your Highness, and I have made it my life's work to preserve the wisdom of our Kolrgiian ancestors. It is this very wisdom that I offer to you, should you choose to accept it.""
