 gh_nattanan_events.0001.t:90 "Choosing a Worthy Heir"
 gh_nattanan_events.0001.desc.intro:90 "For hundreds of years, the holy position of Sepattan has been carefully handed down from generation to generation through a methodical selection process. If the Sepattan's natural child is not worthy to become the next Sepattan, they must summon prospects from the Sacred Grove. As my predecessors have done for generations, I too shall summon two of the strongest young [magi|E] from the Grove and select one of them to be my heir. Once the line of succession is secure, I will be able to focus on defending the land from internal strife, heretics, and foreigners."
