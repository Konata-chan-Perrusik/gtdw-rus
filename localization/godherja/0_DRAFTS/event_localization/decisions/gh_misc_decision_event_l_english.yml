  gh_misc_decision_events.001.b:0 "A majestic palace will display my opulence and dignity."
  gh_misc_decision_events.001.c:0 "What little power I have, I owe to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
  gh_misc_decision_events.001.d:0 "Grand bazaars and well-maintained boulevards will facilitate the inflow and outflow of trade."
  gh_misc_decision_events.001.e:0 "Organized tenement blocks will ensure there is room for the population to grow."
  gh_misc_decision_events.001.f:0 "A great port will spread word of the city's greatness to all corners of the world!"

  gh_misc_decision_events.002.e:0 "I will seek counsel from the great families of the city."
  gh_misc_decision_events.002.d:0 "I'll pull some strings to make sure the right people get the right contracts..."

  gh_misc_decision_events.004.desc:0 "Some people live by an imaginary creed, others heed the words of prophets and holy books. The ledger however, concerns itself only with the practical affairs of the world, and if not respected, will defeat the virtuous and cruel alike. Trade and commerce are the engines which drive all others. I will construct a finely tuned engine of commerce, and it shall drive our civilization to new heights."

  gh_misc_decision_events.005.t:0 "Sophos Civitas"
  gh_misc_decision_events.005.desc:0 "At the root of all cities are beliefs, our understanding of the world and each other. To understand the past is to shape the future. This will be a city enshrined with the knowledge of the wonders that were and may be, the understanding of truths not spoken, and half-truths on the lips of all. To this end, the city shall point as a divine arrow towards the realization of these truths."
  gh_misc_decision_events.005.a:0 "A city of wise men and sages shall be built here."
  gh_misc_decision_events.005.b:0 "A healthy body is a healthy mind."
  gh_misc_decision_events.005.c:0 "Trust in science and technology to build a bright future."
  gh_misc_decision_events.005.d:0 "A sancturary for scholars of the divine."
