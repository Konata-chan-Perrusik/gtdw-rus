 investigate_valerix_decision_desc:0 "When Valerix first gathered his forces for the long march west, he told his assorted legion, "We march not for glory and gain, but for mothers and sons, fathers and daughters. We come home not for glory and not to parade, but for what is right and just. Only we can save our home, now and forever."\n\nEven now that he is dead, his words hang heavy on our souls. It is our duty to make wrongs right, and save our homeland, but before we do that we must avenge the father to us all. How can we save [aversaria|E] if we can not even right this smallest of wrongs?\n\nTo this end I need funds, with which I will gather a taskforce to track down the killer. Let none be safe from the rage of the legion, and let what happens next be a message to all of Aversaria."

The old man was a hero to us all, a living legend, and with his death we sit confused and lost. Who is our enemy? Who would see him dead? Truth be told, the list of suspects is great. Few Aversarians were fond of his message of peace with non-humans, or of the destruction of the [magi|E] caste, but to resort to such means? Who am I kidding, that's the most Aversarian move of all.\n\nBut who? We must know, we need to know. Not only for Valerix's memory, but for our own guidance. We must find our enemy, and we must destroy them. There can be no other recourse.\n\nI have assembled a force to investigate this immediately. It's time we begin asking questions, and preparing our blades."

I tire of it, I have information for you. Take it and kill your enemies, and then give me back my city."\n\nCommon words from him, but the scroll he drops before me has actually useful information. Movements from Öltenic tribesmen under secrecy, all towards the west. Several desertions from new recruits from eastern tribes shortly after the Valerix's death, and the report from the physicians who investigated Valerix's body reporting poison only created in the far east..."

Attempts to bribe him and his clansmen by mysterious agents speaking in [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] accents, Valerix's Öltenic guard of the night not deserting but disappearing shortly after, a woman who was otherwise renowned for her loyalty and honor. Finally, a similar accusation of eastern poison, but instead a note that the seller of which had been captured, and had given the information that the poison was shipped to our port by a third party before committing suicide...\n\nAltan states in the letter that he has no wish to make assumptions on my account, but tells me that the culprit is likely one within my own court..."

The traitors - those who I once considered kin - have proven themselves unworthy of their masks. I will take each one as I drive the dagger into their hearts, for the memory of Valerix must be avenged.\n\nTetradia has sent a token force and coin to assist in the endeavor, hardly any worth mentioning.

 eastern_reforms.0005.desc:0 "Tetradia has, predictably, not taken the accusation well. He has declared me many things in a rather long call to arms against me - traitor, heretic, whore, bitch, lowborn, mongrel, thinblood, and four other pages of insults.\n\nHe does so because he is scared, he does so because he is a fool, he does so because he has no idea how soon he will face justice. Valerix's honored spirit stands with us, as do the Öltenic, and it is by my name and the honor of my Legion that neither will be done shame."

His personal guard - a force of Kikarsag mercenaries - lie dead or sit with swords to their back, having surrendered in the final moments of battle. Around us, his personal estate burns, and I watch as my men slowly escort his slaves out of the premises, the signs of long abuse and torture visible on their half-starved frames.\n\nThe sight of this... to say it fills me with anger would be underselling it, and I drive my blade into Tetradia's thigh as he lets out a high pitched scream.\n\n"Admit it, and I won't make this more painful than it has to be, Tetradia."\n\nThe man whimpers again, and I twist the blade as my men and his watch solemnly. Another scream, and then he nods through tears.\n\n"I did it, damn you! The fool was going to damn us all! Freed slaves? Ridding us of the [magi|E]? The man was an idiot! And so are you, you fucking lowborn whore!"\n\nThe blade is dragged from his thigh slowly, and I sigh.\n\n"My mother was the whore, Tetradia, I am the Legan." With one swift motion, Tetradia's head is lopped off his shoulders, and rolls down the ancient mosaic of his manor, blood filling the gaps.\n\nWith Tetradia dead, Valerix is avenged, and our bond with the Öltenic is forged. Now is the time to see Valerix's dream through, and prepare for the reconquest."

It wouldn't hurt to have more help as well, and the Öltenic have promised their aid in return for their claims in Niodini.
