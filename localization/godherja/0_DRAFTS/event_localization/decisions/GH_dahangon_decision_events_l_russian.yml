 dahangon_decision.0001.desc:0 "The most ancient and revered Heaven-Ordained Semi-Autonomous Bureau of the [Concept('bureau_bronzeport','Bronzeport')|E], has, for countless years since its inception, been governed by High Ministers elected by its esteemed officials. However, the great rebellion of Nalaykan led to the unpopular High Minister Ziajao's ouster and the rise of hereditary rule. Now, High Minister [bronzeport_bureau_restorer.GetFirstName] has decided to restore the government of old, in hopes of bringing back the prosperity that the Bronzeport possessed of yore.\n\nInside the Bureau's famed Chambers of the Entwined Fire and Sky, all of the Bronzeport's officials are gathered around its [zhaen|E]-plated dais, their anticipation thicker than the divine incense that pervaded the room. Before them, the High Minister unrolled the Bureau's ancient charter inscribed on sheets of impossibly thin divine bronze and announced in clear voice heard by all — the Bronzeport shall become a republic once more."

 dahangon_decision.0002.desc:0 "For centuries, Kathun-Kai had long desired to place the southern seas of Dahangon under its control. While the Empire has managed to establish the [Concept('bureau_bronzeport','Bronzeport')|E] and control vital trade routes, distance, the treacherous wetlands, and a lack of interest have done much to dissuade any ambitions of full occupation.\n\nNow however, the pioneering [southsea_protectorate_founder.GetFirstName] has managed to bring these lands under the scepter of the Dragon Emperor, placing [southsea_protectorate_founder.GetHerHim] among the ranks of legendary heroes such as the Sword-Saint Gaorun Mayng, Luo-Ven the Black Wolf, and Xu Qai 'Jadescale'.\n\nStill, this region has time and again proven to be difficult to govern, and [southsea_protectorate_founder.GetFirstName] would need to tread carefully to keep the new Protectorate of the Southsea."

 dahangon_decision.0003.desc:0 "Our most ancient epics sing that at the dawn of time, Apa Kedatal — they who are cloaked in the night — branded upon the skin of our fathers their nine and ninety divine names. However, the great sundering has all but stripped us away of this gift, and through the succeeding centuries it has been the task of our people to recover what we have lost.\n\nNow, the wisest and most powerful of our Markwardens have gathered under my command to rule and guide the Kedari in our search. No longer shall we be ruled by the sword and the spear, and our people will know that power resides in the holy names inscribed upon our bodies and our blood."

 dahangon_decision.0004.desc:0 "Naklan the Golden.\n\nMany-Son, Blackspear, He-Who-Yokes-The-Stars. Naklan was the greatest ruler of our people, and many of those that came after claimed to be his returning. To take on the name and very being of Naklan grants legitimacy and authority to those that dare to do so, and thus, only a select few had managed to be recognized as such.\n\nWith my deeds, however, I have earned the right to be counted among that storied few. As I step onto the magnificent balcony of the golden citadel, Dawang Tarmak, I am greeted by an immense roar of approval from my assembled subjects beneath.\n\n#S “Hail the Reborn!”#!\n\nAs the throng cheer with fervor, I am reminded once again of the sheer weight and responsibility that this identity has. My legitimacy is no longer in question, but I know now that I must not only meet the expectations of being Naklan reborn, but also exceed them."

 dahangon_decision.0005.desc:0 "In the distant past, [nari_daya|E] was denied her Queenship after the death of her father, [naklan_the_golden|E] - the throne instead being passed over to her unworthy nephew. While his reign over Dahangon did not last long due to the Golden Thorn Rebellion, Daya herself would not be able to secure the throne, being forced back into the lands that would become Vehangun.\n\nNow, however, this injustice that spanned millennia has come to an end. As I step upon the balcony of the Golden Citadel Dawang Tarmak, I am greeted by a resounding roar from the assembled Thorn Maidens beneath. They revel in the future that they know is about to come - the mighty reign of the triumphant Thorn Queen."
