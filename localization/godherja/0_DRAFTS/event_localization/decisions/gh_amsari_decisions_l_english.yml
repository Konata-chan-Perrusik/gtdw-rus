 gh_amsari_major_decision.0001.t:89 "The Rot in the East"
 gh_amsari_major_decision.0001.desc:89 "For too long, we have allowed the rot to fester in the east. The Ayyar have ruled with greed and unchecked ambition, believing themselves unshakable.\n\nNow, with all of Amsar secured and the Shehhardi lands firmly under my rule-beyond their reach-their time has come to an end. Their rule, once unquestioned along the coast, is unfit for the future I will shape."

 gh_amsari_major_decision.0002.desc:89 "[hiklahn_qanamsar.GetTitledFirstName] has claimed the entire region as their own.

 gh_amsari_major_decision.0003.desc:89 "It is done. The Ayyar's rule over the eastern coast has been shattered. Their fortresses are abandoned, their banners torn, and their authority reduced to whispers among the dispossessed.

The Coast is no longer ours. Our armies are scattered, our rule is undone.\n\nWhat remains of our people now speak of surrender, exile, or worse. The Hiklahn does not offer mercy, it only takes. And it has taken everything."
 gh_amsari_major_decision.0004.a:89 "So this is how it ends…"
 
 gh_amsari_major_decision.0005.t:89 "The Ayyar Endure"
 gh_amsari_major_decision.0005.desc:89 "Beyond all expectations, [ayyar_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] was able to mount an effective defense against my forces! With [ayyar_ruler.GetHerHis] victory, [byz_emperor.GetSheHe] has given new legitimacy to [ayyar_ruler.GetHerHis] shambling Empire, and tainted my name beyond repair."
 gh_amsari_major_decision.0005.a:89 "This cannot be the end…"

 gh_amsari_major_decision.0006.t:89 "The Hiklahn Repelled"
 gh_amsari_major_decision.0006.desc:89 "Scholars will long discuss what manner of foolishness drew [hiklahn_qanamsar.GetTitledFirstName] to wage war against us.

The Ayyar remain, as we always have, unbowed and unbroken."
 gh_amsari_major_decision.0006.a:89 "There was never any doubt about it."

 dismantle_ayyar_threat_cb:89 "Dismantle Pretender"

 gh_end_western_threat_decision_desc:89 "Since time old, the Amsari have meddled in the affairs of the entire region. Too many times, we have been forced onto the defensive. By controlling the entire coast, we can strike at the heart of their power and end their encroachment once and for all." 
 gh_end_western_threat_decision_tooltip:89 "A war to break the Amsari Hiklahn influence will begin."

 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision_desc:89 "Dreams are more than fleeting visions, they are glimpses into truths unseen. A skilled interpreter may unveil their meaning, offering insight into what lies ahead or what lurks beneath the surface."  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision_tooltip:89 "Seek guidance from a Dream Interpreter."  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision_confirm:89 "Unveil the hidden signs."

 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0001.t.second: "Echoes in the Dark"
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0001.desc.first: "The dream lingers in my mind, its meaning elusive. Images flicker at the edge of memory, symbols unfamiliar yet somehow known, a message just beyond my grasp.\n\nSuch visions are not to be ignored. Some would say dreams are mere echoes of the mind, but I know better. The question remains, should I seek their meaning, or let them fade into the night?"
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0001.desc.second: "They say the one who ignores another's dream is blind, but the one who ignores his own dream is a fool. They are one of many ways the divine communicates with mere mortals, and there are those who decipher their meaning better than others-they hear the truths hidden within dreams. If I seek answers, I will find them. If I turn away, the dream will remain my own, whispering its secrets to deaf ears."
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0001.a: "I will consult my own dream interpreter."

"There is no omen here, no message hidden in the folds of sleep."\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetSheHe|U] looks at me, "Dreams wander where they will, pulling stray thoughts and worries into their grasp. Sometimes, that is all they are."\n\nThe words are meant to be reassuring, but they leave me wondering, was I hoping for something more?" 
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0002.desc.second: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens intently as I recount my dream, [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] expression unreadable. When I finish, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] exhales quietly before offering [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] judgment. "There is nothing to unravel here, [root.GetTitledFirstName]. Just a dream, like countless others before it."\n\nT[dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] folds [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] hands before [dream_interpreter.GetHerHim]. "The mind weaves its own stories in the dark, plucking thoughts from waking life and shaping them into something else. It is natural to wonder if there is meaning, but not every dream carries one."\n\nTThe answer is simple, perhaps too simple..." 
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0002.desc.third: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens as I recount the details of my dream. When I finish, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] shakes [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] head slightly. "There is nothing here worthy of note, [root.GetTitledFirstName]," [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] says. "What you saw was nothing more than the mind's idle wanderings-fragments of memory, stray thoughts stitched together in sleep."\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetSheHe|U] continues, "If it has troubled you, put it from your mind. Some dreams linger, but that does not make them meaningful."" 
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0002.a.first: "Perhaps [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] is right-it was nothing."  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0002.a.second: "Not all dreams hold meaning."  
 
 # Bad Dream

 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0003.desc.first: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens intently as I recount my dream, [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] expression shifting. When I finish, silence lingers before [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] finally speaks. "This is no ordinary dream, [root.GetTitledFirstName]. It is a warning. I have seen such visions before-dreams wrapped in shadow, the wind of misfortune. Whatever it may be, you must be prepared."\n\nI had sought answers-now I wonder if I wished to hear them."  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0003.desc.second: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens as I speak, [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] expression darkening with every word. When I finish, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] sits in silence, fingers tracing unseen patterns against the table. "This is not a dream to be ignored, [root.GetTitledFirstName]. It speaks of misfortune." [dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] says. "The signs are there-discord, unraveling, a fate turning against you. Whether it be treachery or misstep, I cannot say, but the path ahead is uncertain."" 
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0003.a: "If danger looms, then I will meet it head-on."

 # Good Dream
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0004.t: "A Blessing in Sleep"
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0004.desc.first: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens carefully as I recount my dream, [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] expression shifting from contemplation to something almost reverent. When I finish, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] exhales softly, a knowing look in [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] eyes. "This is a dream of fortune, [root.GetTitledFirstName], a sign that the path ahead is one of promise.'\n\nWas this truly an omen of good fortune, or merely a pleasing interpretation of the unknown?" 
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0004.desc.second: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens closely. As I finish speaking, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] leans back slightly. "This is a dream of favor, [root.GetTitledFirstName]," [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] says. "A rare thing indeed."\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] continues, "There are dreams of warning, dreams of confusion, and then there are dreams like this-dreams that come to those whose path is set toward something greater. It is a sign of Zaoran's hand guiding you forward. Whatever lies ahead, you do not face it alone.""

 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0005.desc: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens in silence as I recount my dream, [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] usual calm replaced by something colder. When I finish, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] exhales slowly. "This is not just a dream, [root.GetTitledFirstName]. It is a warning.'\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] leans forward, lowering [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] voice. "It is the mark of a hunter unseen, a danger hidden behind false smiles and familiar voices. Someone moves against you, but the dream offers no face, no name-only the certainty that the knife is already drawn.""  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0005.a: "I will trust no one until I uncover the truth."
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0005.b: "A dream cannot kill me, right?..."
 
 # Murder against you and know the name
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0006.t: "Dream Interpretation"  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0006.desc: "[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens as I recount my dream, [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] expression darkening with each word. When I finish, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] exhales sharply, fingers tightening in thought. "This is no simple vision, [root.GetTitledFirstName]," [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] says. "It is a revelation."\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] looks at me carefully before speaking again. "The dream has given you a name, has it not? Dreams can be cryptic, but some truths slip through-this one too clear to ignore. [murder_schemer.GetFirstName] walks with a dagger in [murder_schemer.GetHerHis] heart, waiting for the moment to strike."\n\n. If the dream speaks true, then the threat is no longer a mystery. The only question now is what to do about it."  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0006.a: "I will not wait for [murder_schemer.GetHerHim] to strike first."

 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0007.desc: "The dream lingers in my thoughts, slipping through my grasp whenever I try to recall it fully. A shadow moving close, a voice-soft, inviting, its words lost the moment I wake. A touch, light as a whisper, vanishing before I can turn to meet its source.\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens, eyes narrowing as [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] weighs my words. After a moment of silence, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] speaks. "There is one who desires you, though whether in silence or in scheming, I cannot say.""  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0007.a: "Then I will uncover them myself."
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0007.b: "Let them play their game.."
 
 # Someone trying to abduct you
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0008.t: "Dream Interpretation"  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0008.desc: "The dream clings to me even after waking-fragmented. Hands grasping from the dark, the ground slipping away beneath my feet, the sense of being pulled somewhere I do not wish to go. A door closing behind me.'\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens carefully, [dream_interpreter.GetHerHis] expression more serious than before. "This is no mere wandering of the mind, [root.GetTitledFirstName]," [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] says, voice low. "This is a warning. Someone seeks to take you, to claim you for their own purpose. The dream does not reveal who, but the intent is clear.""  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0008.a: "I will be ready for them."  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0008.b: " I refuse to live in fear."  


 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0009.t: "Dream Interpretation"  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0009.desc: "The dream moves like a river. What was once distant now looms near-steps that should take years unfolding in mere moments, doors opening before I even reach them. Faces once uncertain now turn to me with knowing eyes.\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens, nodding slowly as I speak. When I finish, [dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] leans forward. "The path before you will not stretch as long as you once thought. The currents of fate are moving, pulling you forward. Whatever you have set in motion, it will come sooner than expected.""

 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0010.t: "Dream Interpretation"  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0010.desc: "The dream was not of distant victories, nor of slow, grinding progress-it was of movement. Walls crumbling before I could lay siege, voices swearing fealty before demands were even spoken.\n\n[dream_interpreter.GetFirstName] listens carefully, "The winds of fate are shifting in your favor, carrying you forward faster than you had planned."
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0010.a: "Then I will seize it without hesitation."

[dream_interpreter.GetSheHe] says at last."  
 gh_consult_dream_interpreter_decision.0011.a: "Then so be it."
