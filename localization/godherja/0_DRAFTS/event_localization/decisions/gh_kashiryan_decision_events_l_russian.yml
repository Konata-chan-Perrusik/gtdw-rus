 taryaad_reformed.0001.desc:0 "For generations, the lands and faiths of Kashirya had remained divided. Avarice for power, for wealth and for personal glory grew unchecked among the region's rulers and polities. But out of all, perhaps the most ruinous was the hunger for knowledge. And when this hunger almost consumed the lands for the second time, Lord Paerasjatan Himself descended to Aeras in the form of an avatar—in the form of the great Asojiva, bless his soul. Defeating the forces of the dead, he proclaimed the kingdom of god that he and his divine descendants would rule henceforth; The [taryaad_saramsaasan|E]. Alas, the divine kingdom that was to last a thousand years ended prematurely in the devastating [vaarash|E] through a combination of inadequate rule and the meddling of the scholars. Yet again Kashirya was in ruins, and with no capable heir to Asojiva present, it regressed to the older age of division and misrule.\n\nBut with my conquest of Asojiva's lands, Kashirya now has a new ruler to guide it, a new dynasty to lead it and a new god to bow down to. By the hilt of my sword and the glint of my new crown, I proclaim myself and my dynasty the new rulers of the reforged Taryaad Saramsaasan!"

 taryaad_reformed.0002.desc:0 "Reports have come from afar, revealing that most of Kashirya has bent its knee to one ruler. Declaring himself the "true heir of Asojiva", this new "god-king" has reforged the long dead empire of the [taryaad_saramsaasan|E]. Whether or not he truly is a descendant of the Taryaad dynasty is irrelevant. It would be wise to not tempt this beast—as it is still quite young and much is yet to be seen how its future will shape."
 taryaad_reformed.0002.a:0 "All I can hope is that it does not veer its eyes here.."

 taryaad_reformed.0003.t:0 "Return of Asojiva's Heir"
 taryaad_reformed.0003.desc:0 "Glory to Paerasjatan! It was long thought that the reign of the Taryaad dynasty was over. That no one being could trump the divinity of Asojiva and his exalted acheivements. That Kashirya would forever remain rudderless in the aftermath of [vaarash|E]. But no longer! A new ruler has emerged after so long, their acheivements eclipsing that of Asojiva himself. They have truly established themself as the real heir to the throne of the [taryaad_saramsaasan|E]—if not by blood, then by pure merit of their actions."
 taryaad_reformed.0003.a:0 "Kashirya will not be rudderless anymore!"

 kashirya_decision.1001.desc:0 "It has been centuries since an Oltenic ruled over the lands of Kashirya. Centuries of conflict, devastation, and turmoil, yet all has its end.\n\nNow, a new Lord governs all the lands from the Kasiryat to the Strait of Knives, seeking to bring back the glory and stability of the [otachedian_empire|E]. Only time will tell if this empire is to prosper"
