 artifacts_flavor.1000.desc:0 "Another late night in my study comes to an end and I groggily begin the short walk to my chambers. As I round the corner and enter the final stretch to reach my bedchambers my gaze is caught by the barest hint of a menacing humanoid form - there in the shadows cloaking the corridor - a flash of yellow-white teeth, a murderous grin drawn right out of my nightmares. I stumble backwards, blood frozen cold in my veins, a cry of panic catching in my throat and emerging only as a phlegmy cough. It takes a moment before my senses return to me and the pale moonlight clarifies the scene. That awful phantom resolves into the all too familiar form of the farcical little Kartharaddi automata crouching in its standby position, its maniac grin staring sightlessly past me. I curse under my breath realizing that the servants must have accidentally left this horrid little imp here when were cleaning and oiling it today."

 artifacts_flavor.1001.desc:0 "It's near midnight, and myself and a small team of scribes and magi have been poring over my copy of the Field of Pearls for the better part of the day already. I can feel that we are close to a breakthrough as individual ciphers and codes begin to converge upon one another pointing towards a single grand mystery. Maybe some secret to the flow of [aervalr|E]'s cycles, or perhaps some mystic pattern to the soundless heartbeat of the world, unknown and unheard to all but the most perceptive of [Concept('dead_magi','Earth Magi')|E].\n\nOr perhaps it is something darker, more terrible than any of these. One of the terrible secrets that haunt the peripheries of the art of [dead_magic|E].

My first instinct is annoyance, but upon taking one look at the stunned and excited expression on the young messenger's face I feel my heart leap into my throat. He barely manages to let slip the word "breakthrough" before I'm pushing past him and running to my laboratory. The [magi|E] I put in charge of the operation looks as surprised as everyone else and they clearly struggle to maintain their composure. "We realized we were approaching the [ROOT.Char.Custom('fieldsofpearlciphername')] all wrong, and the moment we changed our method everything just fell into place." they stammer, and point at the heavily marked copies of the pages in question.

 artifacts_flavor.1005.desc:0 "Perhaps one of the most dangerous aspects of Mas'en Malik's magnum opus are the litany of deadly "trap" rituals that have been written into the work, apparent tests to weed out the unworthy. All of these are accompanied by explicit warnings as to their true nature, but these are written in their own sequences of coded phrases often yet more esoteric and difficult than the suicidal spells they accompany. We knew the risks, and we took every precaution, deciphering far more of the text than we needed so that we might suss out some hint of deception.\n\nIt was not enough.\n\nThe screams of the [magi|E] I assigned to take the lead and their assistants are the first indication that something has gone terribly wrong. I watch in horror as one young man breaks off from scribing a rune on the floor to begin writhing in agony. His panicked cries dwindle first into hoarse rasps, then into stony silence as I am witness to his face disintegrating into an oily, ash-like substance. Glancing around in panic, I can see the baleful effect rapidly spreading through the other participants as the ritual descends into chaos. It may be too late for the others, but if I act quickly in raising a ward I may just be able to save myself. Out of the corner of my eye I can see my [court_magi|E] attempting to do the same."

In but a moment, my whole body ignites with phantom fire and the air in my lungs turns to sulfur, scorching me from both within and without. This pain is beyond physical suffering, beyond mental anguish—the last embers of my rapidly diminishing mind understand that the screaming agony that has descended upon me has its origin in the injury inflicted upon my very being.\n\nIt is only hours later when I am finally able to regain consciousness, feeling as if I was torn apart and then sloppily put back together."
