 anaanide.0001.t:0 "The Steps of Purification"
 anaanide.0001.desc:0 "The road to Anaan begins with a single step to purity.\n\nI entered my chambers, accompanied only by two attendants who started preparing the materials needed for the ritual. Incense was lit, cushions were laid out, and the holy texts were placed before me for easy perusal. The step of purification involves secluding one's self and cleansing one's mind and spirit through a long process of meditation and prayer, a process that may take hours or even days, depending on the worshipper's fortitude and determination.\n\nAs my attendants leave me in solitude, I am reminded of the fact that only the Great Judge knows when I shall finish this step. I mentally steel myself for the long ordeal ahead, and yet, my apprehension remains."
 anaanide.0001.a:0 "I am ready to take the next step."
 anaanide.0001.b:0 "On second thought, maybe now is not the best time."

 anaanide.0002.t:0 "The Final Step"
 anaanide.0002.desc:0 "For an Anaanide to reach the final step is exceedingly rare, and as such, is an occasion accompanied by much revelry. The surrounding towns have been feasting for the past few days, and the air is full of songs and praises to the Great Judge, with Anaanide devotees from distant lands even traveling to join the festivities. I took no part in the celebrations however, spending the night before in prayer to ensure that my soul is completely pure as I take the final step.\n\nFinally, as the sun rose to its full height, I emerged from the temple where I had been meditating and marched to the ritual site accompanied by an entourage of guides, friends, and family. Excitement runs through the air as onlookers observed my march, punctuated by shouts of joy and snippets of prayers.\n\nA thousand paces from the raised platform where I am to undertake the final step, I knelt in prayer, beginning the ritual. Still kneeling, I walked toward the platform while chanting prayers of gratitude to the gods for allowing me to reach this moment. Around me, my companions join me in my chanting to the accompaniment of drums and lyres. Eventually, I reached the center of the platform, which was surrounded by several pyres prepared the day before.\n\nAs I finished my last prayer to the Great Judge, the surrounding pyres erupted in flames of red, green, and gold. I watched as the flames spun and rose, eventually joining into a multicolored pillar of flame. Beyond the inferno, I hear the chants rising into a crescendo as the flames converge upon me in a kaleidoscope of heat and color."
 anaanide.0002.a:0 "And now, my journey ends."

 anaanides_purification.1001.t:0 "The High Guide's Disapproval"
 anaanides_purification.1001.desc:0 "I had just emerged after my long seclusion when [SCOPE.sC('priest').Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )] approaches me.\n\n"I do not believe that you were quite ready to have taken this next step, my liege" [priest.GetSheHe] tells me. "A good [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip] would be wise to be more circumspect about one's purity before trying to ascend.""
 anaanides_purification.1001.a:0 "My purity is already sufficient."
 anaanides_purification.1001.b:0 "Of course. I will try to look deeper within and without before taking the next step."

 anaanides_purification.1003.opening:0 "To my woefully misguided [SCOPE.sC('vassal').Custom2('RelationToMeShort', ROOT.Char )]"
 anaanides_purification.1003.desc:0 "Your decision to seclude yourself to take the next step of purification reeks of carelessness, and someone must take you to task for it. If I do not do it now, then [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] will.\n\nPlease take care of your subjects' grievances first before enclosing yourself from the world!"
 anaanides_purification.1003.a:1 "The World Beyond matters more than this one."

 anaanides_purification.1004.t:0 "Unsavory Rumors"
 anaanides_purification.1004.desc:0 "It seems that my decision to lock myself in seclusion is catching more and more people's attentions.\n\nThey are aware that I am attempting to take the next step to Anaan with my meditations, but whispers have spread that I am doing things behind closed doors, and that people should be more wary of my activities."
 anaanides_purification.1004.a:0 "I couldn't care less what they whisper."
 anaanides_purification.1004.b:0 "If I am open and welcoming, perhaps they would understand?"

 anaanides_purification.1005.opening:0 "My dear [SCOPE.sC('vassal').Custom2('RelationToMeShort', ROOT.Char )]"
 anaanides_purification.1005.desc:0 "I applaud you for the obvious effort you put into your prayers.\n\nThe Great Judge willing, you might just reach the final step within your lifetime."
 anaanides_purification.1005.a:0 "It pleases me that you recognize my effort."
 anaanides_purification.1005.b:0 "Let me teach you how it's done!"

 anaanides_purification.1006.t:0 "A Bad Reputation"
 anaanides_purification.1006.desc:0 "With my penchant for secluding myself in meditation, I have apparently developed quite a reputation. People don't know what it is I do in my seclusion exactly, but they know that they don't want to cross me and find out.\n\nIt's ridiculous, but perhaps it's not entirely a bad thing..."
 anaanides_purification.1006.a:0 "They can be as afraid as their little souls make them."
 anaanides_purification.1006.b:0 "Swearing that I do no harm will put them at ease."

 anaanides_purification.1007.t:0 "A Sudden Illness"
 anaanides_purification.1007.desc:0 "The recent session of meditation and prayer has taken much longer than usual to finish. Hours upon hours was spent kneeling on the cold floor of my sanctum as I struggled to perfectly recite the prayers, and like any good Anaanide, I have abstained from partaking in any food all the while.\n\nWhile my soul is fulfilled after the step's completion, the toll on my body cannot be ignored."
 anaanides_purification.1007.a:0 "The satiation of the inner body matters more in Anaan."

 anaanides_purification.1008.t:0 "An Unexpected Miracle"
 anaanides_purification.1008.desc:0 "Despite my weakened condition, I did what I could to complete the step of purification.\n\nThe ordeal was difficult, but [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] has rewarded by faith by giving me a miracle for my malady!"
 anaanides_purification.1008.a:0 "I am cured!"
