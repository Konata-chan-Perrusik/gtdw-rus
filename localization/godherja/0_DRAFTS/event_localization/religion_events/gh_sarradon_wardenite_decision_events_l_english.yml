 wardenite_decisions.0002.desc:0 "At the time of the [Concept('saints_war','Saints Crusade')|E], the [Concept('wardenism','Wardenite')|E] faith seemed doomed.

Many who should have known better claimed that the Final Confrontation was at hand, and that the Dead God would break free - a fitting punishment for our failure.\n\nAs we stand astride [sarradon|E] these days seem distant now. Even noble [tathtali|E] never held dominion over so much of Sarradon"
