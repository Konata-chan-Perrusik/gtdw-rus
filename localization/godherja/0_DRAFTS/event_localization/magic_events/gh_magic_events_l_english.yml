 magic.0001.desc.generic:89 "We converge [Localize(SCOPE.GetFlagName('spell_location'))], and begin our preparations. Ritual lines scrawled in chalk spill across the floor, their disparate lines twisting to join together at vertices, their angles conforming to perfected numerologies splayed out before me. Crouching apprentices huddle as they diligently work to finish the Capstone Runes, their dust stained robes frayed at the knees and elbows where their hours of dedicated labor has finally begun to take its toll on their vestments.\n\nOnce the final preparations are finished, the true work begins. An acolyte gingerly hands me the [ROOT.Var('spell_being_casted_var').Story.Custom('RandomSpellTool')] and [ROOT.Var('spell_being_casted_var').Story.Custom('RandomSpellIngredient')] required for the process, and I begin. After some time, the ritual finally concludes. "

 magic.0001.desc.sundeath:89 "The Ritual is complete.\n\nThe sky bleeds like a sacrificial lamb upon the altar, the screams of millions of lives both on this plane and from the beyond echo out in the heavens. In the sky, beyond the flickering light of a now-dying star, past the aborted echoes of creation, the glorious Void shudders in ecstasy and delight and slowly grows and grows.\n\nAs one by one the constellations that all of man have looked on for hope and guidance flicker out and die as they slide into the greedy maw of the Void Gods, the sun itself-the wretched symbol of creation and life that has befouled the emptiness-gives out one last shuddering scream of pain. Around the world thousands die from the power of its death moans. Existence is over, there shall be only darkness!"
 ## Ritual-Specific
 magic.0001.desc.wisdom_of_the_leaf_whispers.intro:89 "The ancient forests of the world are said to sometimes whisper secrets and wisdom — and I intend to listen. For hours, I've been meditating at a particularly noisy section of woodland, keenly taking note of every rustling of the canopy and creak of old trees, trying to make sense of the unassuming ambience.\n\n"
 magic.0001.desc.wisdom_of_the_leaf_whispers.success:89 "I'm in luck today, for the forest is talkative."
 magic.0001.desc.cedar_witchs_hex.intro:89 "My acolytes assemble the effigy just before the first rays of dawn begin to break through the thick canopy above us, and soon set it aflame and begin the chants of the #underline Cedar-Witch's Hex#!. The words are ancient, their language not used as a vernacular for millennia, with only the slightest hint of a resemblence to modern Thalite. Though the effigy burns brilliantly, it does not seem to take any visible damage, and the surrounding air becomes nearly choked with smoke." 
 magic.0001.desc.cedar_witchs_hex.success:89 "\n\nJust as it becomes difficult to breathe, the wooden figure suddenly disintegrates into ash, and the air rapidly clears. We prepare to leave as soon as possible; though the forest feels tranquil as it is bathed in the light of the morning Sun, it is not safe to linger here for long." 
 magic.0001.desc.twin_gods_hex_of_wrath.intro:89 "My acolytes assemble the wooden effigy just before the first rays of dawn begin to break through the thick canopy above us, the sung Komihow limb is attached, and we begin the chants of the #underline Chan Fei Teib Transit Kon Crod#!. The words are ancient, their speaking of the Gods Tongue resemble no language any has heard. As the chanting raises in tempo the Effigy glows with a great light, and begins to sprout, dust rises and the air becomes nearly choked with it." 
 magic.0001.desc.twin_gods_hex_of_wrath.success:89 "\n\nJust as it becomes difficult to breathe, the wooden figure sprouts into a Komihow Tree, and the air rapidly clears. Hymns of praise are sung by all until noon, when all disperse comfortable in the jungles shade." 
 
 magic.0001.desc.embercrown_coronation.intro:89 "All throughout the evening and into the night, my acolytes and loyal courtiers perform the three steps of the coronation ritual. First comes the offering of a long, formulaic oath; then, the casting of their offerings into the ritual bonfire; and finally, each joins a growing chorus of exaltation of my name.\n\nBy midnight, the chants of "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]! [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]!" grow nearly deafening. A fell wind swirls around the ritual site as the fire at its heart contorts in strange and mesmerizing patterns. Now comes the final step, and it is imperative that I show no hesitation at all for the [magic|E] at hand to succeed. I walk into the bonfire, steeling myself against the pain — and emerge on the other side. "
 magic.0001.desc.embercrown_coronation.success:89 "The flames suddenly disperse, and all that remains is a faint halo of embers around my head.\n\nBut there is something else there, as well. An air of resplendence, of wisdom and clarity that only a lifetime of rule could bring, and the vaguest inkling of strange memories that do not belong to me."

 apocalypse_sundeath.0003.desc:89 "The Ritual is complete.\n\nCrying doomsayers and mad prophets, ailing [magi|E] and panicked spirits, all have tried to warn mankind of the coming doom. Of the evils that would consume us all. We did not take it seriously, or perhaps we simply failed. All of humanity has been punished, all of us found wanting. The world is over, like never before, and never it shall be after.\n\nAbove us our star flickers and dies. Thousands fall with it, struck down by the screams emanating from the heavens as the fading sun bleeds a hellish red across a now-hostile sky. Where once there were thousands of stars placed there by the loving hand of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], there is now but a yawning void that grows to consume even when there seems nothing left to take but emptiness. In every shadow the ancient dead cry out in fear and pain, in the streets corpses in the thousands pile from those who have given themselves to despair. There is nothing left, if any divine once stood with us they too have now vanished into the dead heavens. \n\nThese are the end times."

 apocalypse_sundeath.0022.desc:89 "Though some had hoped that the false twilight that emerged after the Sun's death would continue to bathe Aeras in a last, meagre ray of light and hope, even this proved too much to ask for. With little warning, the arcane phenomenon has rapidly diminished in COUNTY over the last few days, and now it has finally been enveloped by true, pitch-black night — forever.\n\nAs the area is entombed by ice and snow, there no longer being any source of warmth to keep the lethal cold at bay, what little human life was still clinging on to a miserable existence there is being snuffed out once and for all. Very soon, only shades, the undead and other twisted abominations that dwell in the dark will call this wretched place home."

 ## Divination
 divination_intro_generic:89 "The tools of divination laid out in front of me,"
 divination_interpretation_generic:89 "I study the results of the ritual down to the smallest detail —"
 divination_intro_fire:89 "By application of an iron rod warmed by fire until it glows orange, I heat the plastron bone until it chars and cracks. Gripping the still-hot bone"
 divination_interpretation_fire:89 "The spiderweb of cracks spreading out from the center of the plastron, where I carved my question prior to the ritual, the shards of broken bone jutting from the tortoise shell,"
 divination_intro_water:89 "We sprinkle expensive powdered spices over a silver dish and leave it in the courtyard in anticipation of rain. We do not have long to wait before the gathering clouds above begin to pelt us with fat raindrops, and we retreat inside to await the storm's end. Once the last drop has fallen,"
 divination_interpretation_water:89 "The rain-etched patterns tell a story forming the dark spice into line-charts, half-formed symbols, and nearly distinguishable figures,"
 divination_intro_ice:89 "I have procured at great expense a block of pristine ice almost as tall as I am, apparently carved from a pure and unsullied mountain lake. Lifting a heavy iron sledgehammer above my head I strike the block with all my might, sending cracks through its its glass-like body."
 divination_interpretation_ice:89 "The fractal spirals of cracks are a nightmare to decipher, extending in every direction through the block.  Yet in the mess a form takes shape. The subtle arcing of fissures and fractures, my increasingly numb and cold hands working across the meltwater-slick surface to trace their paths. There is something here,"
 divination_intro_stone:89 "Taking thirteen pristine and uncut gemstones, I cast them upon the diagram I have carved into the sand."
 divination_interpretation_stone:89 "Here I see where the rosy-pink ruby has fallen, there I inspect where the lilac of the rough amethyst lies. Through several long hours I meticulously mark their places upon the chart,"
 divination_intro_air:89 "Having let fall the jumble of marked and feathered darts,"
 divination_interpretation_air:89 "The position of the green dart marked 'Death', whether any of the half dozen orange darts marked with symbols of prosperity have lodged themselves point-first into the hard earth, and the subtle meaning behind the chaotic jumble of shafts lying atop one another,"
 divination_intro_dream:89 "Consuming a bitter concoction of herbs, I fall into a deep and unpleasant slumber. Awakened groggily and unhappily with the first rays of dawn, my assistants quickly hand me a wax tablet and stylus to record the strange nightmares which befell me. In the afternoon, when the narcotic effects of the herbs have fully worn off,"
 divination_interpretation_dream:89 "The vistas I recollect are strange and unpleasant. The narratives make no sense, as my feverish dreamscape shifted from form to form. Yet, as I study them certain patterns begin to emerge,"
 divination_intro_celestial:89 "My star charts prepared I begin my lonely observation, shivering in the chill midnight wind."
 divination_interpretation_celestial:89 "The conjunction of constellations above, a chaotic whorl of stars and shapes. Which heavenly bodies have decided to grace me with their presence tonight, and which have chosen to remain hidden behind the cloak of night,"
 divination_intro_light:89 "I spend an entire day in the wilderness, observing the play of light upon a rocky outcropping, recording what I see. As the sun finally sets below the horizon,"
 divination_interpretation_light:89 "The cast of the hill's shadow may seem mundane to the unenlightened, but to one with the skill to see it certain patterns and forms emerge in the transit of light and shadow across its face,"
 divination_intro_blood:89 "The bloody mass of animal liver lying before me,"
 divination_interpretation_blood:89 "A raised polyp here, a shriveling there, a mottled pattern on the organ that looks just so —"
 divination_intro_nature:89 "Pouring the tin cup of molten wax into a copper basin of cold water which is then drained, I am left with dozens of chaotic gobbets of molten wax."
 divination_interpretation_nature:89 "The unique shape of each waxen blob, some long strands, others spherical globules, some others almost approaching a vaguely recognizable human form,"
 divination_intro_dark:89 "We trek out into the countryside, eventually setting up our ritual site in an isolated copse of trees. As the sun sets we light our bonfire, and as the hours approach midnight we release the caged owl, carefully studying the path the animal takes in its frenzied escape into the dark of night."
 divination_interpretation_dark:89 "Studying the sketch and my own recollections of the angle of the bird's flight, I begin to discern certain patterns. The number of times the bird's wings flapped, the soft fall of dislodged plumage, and the amount of time it spent indignantly staring at us perched in a tree at the edge of the clearing,"
 divination_intro_sand:89 "I gently let the sand fall from my fingers, sifting it out onto the roughly worked brass sheet."
 divination_interpretation_sand:89 "Staring for long hours at the ridges and divots in the layer of sand my vision begins to swim. The meaningless and disordered patterns begin to order themselves into half-formed letters and distorted faces. These patterns and"
 divination_intro_metal:89 "Pouring the cup of molten lead into a copper basin of cold water which is then drained, I am left with dozens of chaotic and lumpen ingots."
 divination_interpretation_metal:89 "The unique shape of each leaden blob — some long strands, others spherical globules, some others almost approaching a vaguely recognizable human form —"
 divination_intro_dawn:89 "Leaving a number of ritual objects upon my windowsill whose nature I feel is representative of the subject of my augury, I await the rising of the sun, and roughly chalk the patterns of shadows left by the rosy light of dawn. Once the orb has cleared the horizon,"
 divination_interpretation_dawn:89 "The chalklines marking the creep of the shadows up the walls, and the unexpectedly elongated forms taken by the objects,"

Following this, I and my acolytes begin effusing immense amounts of [Concept('magic','Magical')|E] energy, and the entirety of the area around us takes on the same greenish glow as our eyes. Without warning however, one of the acolytes abruptly slumps to the floor, drained of energy. Though a servant swiftly rushes out to help the acolyte to his bed, the rest of us strain in our attempt to guide the celestial body's path, but we are soon exhausted of power as well and the ritual spirals out of control.\n\nA servant promptly starts screaming in terror at the massive object headed directly our way, and I look up in resignation tinged with fear.

No matter how much energy we pour into the ritual, the circle refuses to stabilize, and what's more, our efforts seem to only contribute to the further destabilization of the ritual.
