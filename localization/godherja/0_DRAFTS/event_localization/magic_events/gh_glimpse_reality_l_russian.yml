 glimpse_reality.0001.desc:0 "As the ritual circle glows with a familiarly uncanny blue light, my all too limited vessel of bone and fat grows heavy beneath me while my mind takes flight, traveling to that transcendental realm once more. Ethereal wings bear me through the never ending well of power rising up like a pillar of flame from the tremendous abyss beneath me. Though the light of my own mortal eyes has grown increasingly dim through incessant use of the gift, here nothing can elude the power of my gaze.\n\nMore arcane energies flow into the ritual, revealing thin strands of light that I need only reach out and grasp. I glide through the endless domain and am steadily pulled towards more vibrant threads that glow like stars in the darkness. I reach out with formless, disembodied hands and survey what strand to grasp..."

The shapeless crowd is indistinct - their silhouettes melding into one another, their ceaseless chatter like a discordant choir.\n\nOccasionally, individual shapes weave in and out, many of them familiar to me - their conversations rise above the background noise and echo off the rafters, each offering a unique glimpse of insight that may have gone by unnoticed in the mundane world. Sometimes, I even see myself as the speaker[SelectLocalization(GetPlayer.HasTrait(GetTrait('arrogant').Self),' — dashing and eloquent, as always —',',')] though I cannot recall ever participating in some of these exchanges.\n\nFinally, the din and press of the crowd grows too much to resist, and the vision ends in darkness.

Instead of boots or feet, I find myself walking on cloven hooves, my head weighed down by a crown of antlers. In the distance glistens a moonlit pool, the near silver water beckoning me closer, until my lips finally reach its cold surface. It is then, I hear the crack of a branch and the flight of birds, my head turning to spot a shrouded figure with its bow drawn. The arrow penetrating my hide and sending me crashing to the floor. I can only wait as the hunter approaches, walking around until they are crouched right in front of me and pulling back their hood. My own eyes, staring back at me."

The room above me stretches and warps around me as if viewed through warped glass.\n\n 'My lady' A young man with tanned skin and raven-dark hair straightens from a deep bow, maintaining a demeanor of deliberate courtly decorum with polished ease. The room around me takes a moment to clarify, but as my visions clears around me appear a broad court packed with uniformed soldiers, courtiers, and servants. The entire tableau is lit from above with mid-day sun, cascading down the faces of all those in attendance, most prominently the hawkish face of a young woman of similar age. She sits atop a throne of dark cedar, inlaid with a filigree of a metal the hue of the setting sun, and stares down at him with an expression mirroring his in poise and manufactured grace. Both shine with the silver skein of destiny about them. The fate of a continent rests here, not with an army, but with one man and one woman.\n\n'If you would take my hand in union, I pledge to you that I will make right the honor of your family as if it were my own. I offer you a marriage of equals - what is yours is mine, and mine yours, until the Final Ending take us both.' A clever piece of theater - the woman doesn't even shift from her throne as she accepts the proposal with a curt and poised 'yes'. Both radiate the threads of destiny, and I feel as if I am drowning in a flood of spiderwebs.\n\nIt's theater now, but in time she will love him in her own pragmatic way. A younger version of her struggles to maintain composure as she stands in the presence of the ruptured and burnt body of a girl who cannot be older than eight summers. She sits aged and with a physician, her husband away on campaign with many years left to live, and she the last of her name. A youth once more, she rides precariously between the arrayed lines of two armies, bellowing a defiant cry as her cavalry charges in the name of a doomed cause.\n\nThe young man also bleeds destiny. A dozen generations will preach in his name. Will kill in his name. Will die in his name. His fame will be stamped across the fate of a continent, and then further beyond.\n\nI gasp as if rising from suffocation as the vision ends and I find myself in my ritual chamber once more."

I hear chanting interspersed with small mutterings and follow it until I come across a lone man waving his arms as if in a trance. He wears a robe with skulls fastened across its belt and a pair of antlers that protrude from a band on his head. He opens his eyes and I see that he is nearly blind, the cloudy white liquid within swirling hypnotically.\n\n"You're not supposed to be here, heh.”\n\nI freeze, thinking he is talking to me, but I turn around and see a powerful man in tribal garb who has appeared out of the mist. His bearded face is troubled as he speaks.\n"Do not question me, [magi|E].”\n\nThe Magi smiles. "The crows dance upon your arrival, Cenware, twas a massacre, I see, I see, [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] blood washes the hills, yes, yet the sun shines on the Sjalvolki, absolving you of sin.”\n\nCenware seems nonplussed by his ramblings. "The Aversarians are routed, they pose no more resistance. Dissipate the fog and stop the madness.”\n\n"Hm. Yes. Tell the wind to stop blowing and the cock to stop crowing.” Nevertheless, the fog starts to clear, revealing the afternoon sun. The battlefield before us is littered with Aversarian bodies with Sjalvolki warriors raising their weapons in the air, celebrating.\n\nThe two stand in silence for a moment, then Cenware speaks. "What right did we have, Jarogg, to destroy a thousand years of empire? Tyrants, blood-worshippers, and despots ruled, but even the vilest of snakes have a clutch of eggs to keep. They lived and died like the rest of us, and soon there will be nothing left of them. Was it inevitable, or could I have taken a different path?"\n\nCenware glances at the Magi, but it is clear he is no longer listening, captivated by the fog inside his mind.\n\nThe vision fades out as I witness a few tears streaming down Cenware's cheeks as he stares at a tattered Aversarian banner."

I listen in for a while, mystified as to the reason I was brought here, and just as I'm about to end the vision, something catches my ear.\n\nI reexamine the contract and discussion, making sure I had heard correctly. And indeed I had, there was a flaw in this truce, a loophole that could be used to end it early with little argument. I could now easily return to war, if I so desired. Alternatively, [target.GetName] would certainly appreciate it if I pointed out this issue, and worked with him to fix it. It would certainly give me a reputation for being reasonable."

The surrounding plaza is bustling with armed men in tribal garb, though apart from a few that are carrying valuables and some billows of smoke on the horizon, they do not seem to be actively looting. Most are uproariously cheering, while some taunt the people peering through the windows and balconies - who seem to be in a decidedly less celebratory mood.\n\nNearby loiters the apparent leader of this army, a man of impressive build and a contemplative look, surrounded by a pack of advisors whose appearances are only scarcely less fierce. A group of nobles and a king clad in a distinctly different style of clothing approach, corralled by a group of soldiers, though the vision ends just before they reach the tribal overlord."

A group of mercenary knights stand their ground against a horde of screaming bearded warriors, but they are clearly outnumbered, and have been abandoned to their fate. A dense [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E] swiftly rolls in, concealing a berserker as he swings his axe and slams a young squire to the ground. In an instant, the other knights close ranks and manage to drag the young squire behind their lines as the berserker is run through with extreme prejudice.\n\nThe wind whips and swirls, forming a massive undulating column of mist. A massive paw the size of a tree trunk rips out of the column, out of which appears a monstrosity: eyeless, scales running down its body in stripes that ripple and gleam in the morning sun. It stands on its hind legs like a man, swinging a giant claw towards the knights. Those who are not fast enough are instantly crushed into bloody pulp. Shaken, the remaining soldiers scramble to surround the bear-like abomination.\n\nThen, the sound of a clarion! Knights on horseback pour through the broken line and charge the [Concept('fogbeasts','Fogbeast')|E]. Their leader's helm is blood-red, his sword arm outstretched, and he cuts off the bear's leg with one, powerful strike. The beast's roar sounds like the screams of a thousand men as it topples over, narrowly missing the still dazed squire in its descent. The red knight stops and extends a hand to the confused young man on the ground.\n\n"Up! Up, you bastard!" The knight looks about, his sneer of contempt hidden by his enclosed bascinet, "The craven [magi|E] have abandoned us to the wolves! They are devoid of honor! Unburnished by glory! They expect us to sacrifice our lives for the sake of their dying empire. I spit on their coin and their damned emperor! Come!" He turns his horse around while pointing, "We ride for the coast!"\n\nThe vision starts to fade, but on the other side of the battlefield, I see the silhouette of a powerful man on a horse. He looks serenely at the retreating knights while cleaning his sword. The last scene I see is him raising his hand up in a salute."

 glimpse_reality.0505.tooltip:0 "Within the strand I see great martial feats"
 glimpse_reality.0505.desc:0 "The thread transports me to an unfamiliar courtyard. The atmosphere is silent, the air noxious with a rain of ash falling like snow. Illuminated by the light of the full moon, I spot a lone knight meditating under the shade of a gnarled, dead tree in the center of the yard. A second figure appears out of the billowing ash-clouds: a skeletal monstrosity clad in long, flowing robes and an ornate crown towering over their bared skull. Two enormous jewels are embedded in their eye sockets and their bones glow with an obscene light.\n\n"We meet again, whelp. Where is your loyal retinue now?”\n\n"I come alone, [Concept('liches','Lich')|E].”\n\nThe skeleton points a bony finger towards the young man. "I am [arch_lich|E] Milon Zackowic the God-Touched, and I will not be lied to by an insolent child! My body harnesses the light of the divine, did you think I would not notice the dozens of crossbows trained on me from the windows? The swarm of men hiding themselves, waiting to charge me at once? Tell me, little king, do you think I am a fool?”\n\nThe man slowly rises. "Come closer, and I'll tell you anything you want.”\n\n"Oho!” the arch lich replies, cackling. "What you lack in wits, you make up in pride! Come then, let us finish this!” They seem to glide forward as they approach the knight. Instantly, a huge wave of arrows crests over the stalls as a mass of soldiers pour out of the buildings. The arch lich dodges the projectiles effortlessly, the iron-tipped arrows curving around him. He raises his arms to the sky as a horde of shambling wights materializes out of the ash.\n\nUndeterred, a particularly fearsome warrior charges up and slices two wights in half with a single slash. Sensing this challenger, the lich turns to him and clenches his fist, stopping the soldier in his tracks. In a quick swipe of his skeletal hands, the lich sends the knight hurtling towards a wall. The other men approach, then fall screaming as their heads are crushed by their own helmets crumpling like paper. The young king swings, futilely. The arch lich twists and snaps the sword in his grasp. A flashbang lands between them, exploding and blasting the boy across the courtyard and against the tree.\n\nWhat's left is devastating. His men are overwhelmed, the arch lich's robes have nary a scratch and his skull glowing more brightly than before. The skeleton's voice is mirthful and proud. "Watch as your world bends and twists to my will, boy. Now, die.” His jewels glow, a beam of flame bursting out of them, instantly setting the tree alight with the king barely jumping out of the way. Then, a roar. The fearsome knight has recovered, charging the arch lich and earning two burning holes in his chestplate.\n\nWith the arch lich distracted, the king snaps off a long branch off the burning tree and hurls it through the air like a javelin. It hits the arch lich square in the ribs, igniting his robes. He cackles and wails as he struggles to put it out. The king retrieves his broken sword, sprints, and beheads the screaming skeleton from behind. The vision fades as the light of the bones flickers and dies."

A truly magnificent city sprawls below me, its winding streets extending to the horizon in every direction. On the edges I see the very example of misery, tiny houses falling apart in a labyrinth of decay, and people flowing through narrow passageways like maggots on a rotting corpse. In the center, however, golden domes reflect blinding sunlight like the most opulent of crowns, and I lower myself to see what wondrous things might I find there./n/nMy ethereal form passes through a massive, stained glass window into a building that must surely be a palace.

Something... hooded? Naked? Without form? Their back turned to me, They stare into an abyss of light, a swirling hole at the center of which I realize is my own world. I try to see my homeland, and then am back within my chambers.\n\nMy sigh of relief is short, for as I stand, I see the shadows twist and turn with color. Before me sits myself, several servants quietly whispering in the corners as they watch me, and I scream and panic as I realize that I am trapped outside my own body when... the colors streak, they fly from the shadows as if returning to their home. As they strike me in a mass, absorbing through my skin, filling my mouth, my eyes open anew.\n\nI am back in my body now, and realize that the room is in a state of disarray, the servants stumbling to their feet or laying dazed on the floor from what they shout was a blast of great magic.

I recognize it, for my own body must now share in it.\n\nThe stone floor gives in beneath my feet as the cave crumbles, the vision coming to an end. I fall through the dark sky, rivers of silver far below me forming into a road, a path, a map. I study it in those fleeting moments before the shackle of flesh takes me once more, knowing that it will lead me back."

I twist and struggle as the riptide of energy threatens to drag the very essence of my now-ethereal body out into a bottomless ocean of power.\n\nIt is with exhaustive effort that I am able to slow myself, grabbing hold of a rocky outcropping of congealed essence. I am somewhere deep beneath the earth - a tiny point of light hovering above a subterranean lake of immense proportions. Below me, what appears to be a half-submerged tower miles in length lies on its side, the structure calling to mind a staff or wand built for the proportions of a giant. To my [magi|E]'s eyes, it appears as a horrifying whirlpool, dragging on me with a force greater than any storm wind. I know for certain that this is why I am here.\n\nIf I but let go, I will be able to descend to investigate further, possibly learning things that no other man has ever known.

Striding past the braziers upon which our sacramental wood burns, I grip my restrained prisoner. A [magi|E] like me perhaps, but unlucky enough to not be prey instead of predator. Turning their head upwards, I see their eyes are already clouded, clinging feebly to consciousness with a dribble of spit leaking from the corner of their mouth. Blinking back the soporific effects of the smoke I begin to intone the susurrating syllables of the spell as I stare unblinkingly into my sacrifice's eyes.\n\nThere in the space between our gazes a silver thread spins into existence as if from nothing, a connection between our souls. Drawing upon it with a motion akin to a seamstress lifting a needle in one hand, I pull #P it #! forth. Formless and intangible, yet with a terrible gravity that seems to tug at the billowing smoke, it lingers only an instant before it is pulled into my own body. The shock of the sudden joining severs the connection between us with the force of a hammer blow, and I am sent sprawling backward dazed, disoriented, but empowered beyond my wildest imagination."

Soon I am tumbling gracelessly through the void, all pretenses of control lost.\n\n Inside the storm the indistinct blurs twisting within resolve themselves around me: here beside me tumbles the ectoplasmic form of a young peasant woman, arrow jutting horrifically from her ruined eye socket; there in front of me the bony apparition of a skeletal [magi|E] wearing magnificent robes writhes, screams of rage impotent against the vortex. For my own part I can feel myself stretched to the brink, my projected body twisting like dough in the terrible gravity of the toppled tower below me\n\nWith agony and fear as my guides I tear away, riding the momentum until the last possible minute before deflecting my spectral body off the metal body of the eldritch construct. I spin towards the ceiling of the subterranean cavern, almost delirious from the pain. Even as I fly to freedom, I can feel a yawning ache in my soul; a void where a substantial portion of my own magical potential has been ripped from me."

A lone, final skeptic begins their stride towards the thing not of this world, their stare never wavering.\n\nAnd the light stares back.\n\nThe vision begins to distort under the sheer force of the event, wild strands rapidly appearing and disappearing between the two, and the masked figure is embraced by the luminance.

At this point I am not ever sure if I am still falling.\n\nAs I hand suspended and helpless, one reaches out with a shining hand of unnaturally blue ice to touch my forehead. I feel power running through me, as if I am casting a spell. Moving my hand, I grab the arm of the ice statue and pull it off my skin, only to instead feel that same power.

The disembodied whispers and occasional distant screams are easy enough to get used to, so long as one simply does not listen to them too closely.

There is no day and night in this hell - only a dull, crimson twilight, with a bloody moon standing vigil over the carnage below. A weak wind rolls over the land occasionally, carrying the muffled sounds of torment of the departed.\n\nMy eyes affix to the most prominent nearby landmark - a towering throne of chained people, clockwork and... metallic vials, of some kind? Atop it sits a figure black as pitch, wearing a crown rusted by the taint of blood. They stand mute and unmoving, gazing upon their hellish dominion and paying no heed to the torment of the chained servants of their throne.\n\nThere is something very wrong about this figure. They are not just a shadow, they are a #BOL void#! within existence itself. Whoever they once were, not even my magic can recall anymore.

The agony drives my mind to flight, but there is no escape, no blissful retreat from this vision of misery. I look to the side, and what I see makes me sob tears of blood, a great and glorious dragon twisted into an unnatural shape in a mockery of life.\n\nDenial courses through me, and I futilely attempt to dismiss this vision as a nightmare that is all too real. The compassionate beast reaches for me with one broken, mangled hand as a wave of horrible power causes its head to burst into flames. A sound of terror, grief, sadness, fright and horror emerges from my throat as my mind forces its way out of the vision. I flee, watching the fog itself weep. Even after returning to my body, I remain in a dreamlike state for days afterwards, the same scenes of horror repeating again and again."
