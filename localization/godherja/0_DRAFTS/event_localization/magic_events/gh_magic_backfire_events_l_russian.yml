 # Harmless Backfire
 magic_backfire.0001.t:89 "Failure"
 magic_backfire.0001.desc.fail.harmless:89 "\n\nUnfortunately, it is clear that the ritual has had seemingly no effect, though it thankfully also seems to have not put me into any immediately evident danger. All that I can do now is ruminate on what went wrong, and try to be better prepared next time."
 magic_backfire.0001.a:89 "But I did everything right..."
 
 # Wounding
 magic_backfire.0011.t:0 "The Perils Of Magic"
 magic_backfire.0011.desc.fail.wounding:89 "Energies beyond my control run riot throughout the ritual chamber. Apprentices and cabal-members alike are struck off their feet by lines of power which move with an almost malevolent force. I can taste blood in my mouth as my vision begins to swirl, arcane gibberish forcing itself from my mouth as if my tongue has been gifted a mind of its own. It's too much. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] name it's too much for me to control!"
 magic_backfire.0011.desc.embercrown_coronation.fail.wounding:89 "The pain that I've tried to ignore becomes overwhelming as my clothing catches fire! I drop to the ground and roll as my assistants scramble to put the flames out; rather than a fiery crown, all I will receive for my efforts are horrific burns."
 magic_backfire.0011.a:0 "Someone help me get this under control!"
 
 
 magic_backfire.0012.t:0 "A Rash Arcane Explosion"
 magic_backfire.0012.desc:0 "\n\nAs I begin the final step to cast my spell, I misspeak a word. Immediately the spell begins to unravel as I begin to feel a pain in my chest. Rashes appear on my body from the magical energies with nowhere to go. If I don't get this under control something terrible wil-"
 magic_backfire.0012.a:0 "It burns, it burns!"
 
 magic_backfire.0021.t:0 "Miscast!"
 magic_backfire.0021.desc:0 "\n\nIt briefly seems to have succeeded — but the arcane energies seem to gravitate towards a direction that's not quite the one we expected. It does not take long for us to realize that while the spell might have succeeded, whether it actually affected our target is a different question altogether..."
 magic_backfire.0021.a:0 "Oops."
 hex_backfire_tt:89 "@warning_icon! #X This was the result of a [ritual] that backfired, whether knowingly or not#!"
 
 magic_backfire.0022.t:0 "Misaligned Miscast!"
 magic_backfire.0022.desc:0 "\n\nAs the flames from the brazier rise something feels wrong - looking around I can see one of my acolyte's lines was not drawn at the right angle. The spell is cast but there is no telling if it hit the intended target..."
 magic_backfire.0022.a:0 "Oh well."
 magic_backfire.0031.t:0 "Poisoned Dreams"
 magic_backfire.0031.desc:0 "According to reports by my assistants I collapsed mid-ritual, falling into a deep slumber from which I could not be awoken for nearly a full day. My hopes that it was a harmless mishap slowly erode as successive nights see my dreams warp and twist. Nightmares with the faces of my parents stalk me through blood-sodden forests, trees of coiled and fleshless bodies moan alluringly. My waking hours are haunted by the unbidden memories of the unspeakable acts my nightly pursuers force me to commit, and the looming dread of having to lay down for sleep as the sun sets once more."
 magic_backfire.0031.a:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], grant me relief from slumber."
 magic_backfire.0032.t:0 "Dreaming of a Hole"
 magic_backfire.0032.desc:0 "The failure of the ritual seemed at first a harmless mishap. It was only when I lay my exhausted head down for slumber that its true ramifications became apparent. Every dream, from the most twisted nightmare to the most pleasant and peaceful is rudely interrupted by the presence of a yawning hole in the sky. It hurts to even look at it, and it hurts even more when the things on the other side start moving. I sometimes awaken with bloody tears staining my cheeks. "
 magic_backfire.0032.a:0 "Please [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], I don't want to see them anymore."
 magic_backfire.0033.t:0 "Serpent Dreams"
 magic_backfire.0033.desc:0 "I could have sworn I felt something grasp for control of the magical energies, devouring the raw power as I desperately struggled for supremacy. My assistants swear up and down they felt no such thing, but upon my next slumber the truth of my intuition is confirmed. A serpent now haunts my dreams, fat like a well-feasted grub and bearing a leering human face that feels so familiar, like a family member I have somehow forgotten. He whispers secret things to me as I sleep. I think I will miss Him when He is gone."
 magic_backfire.0033.a:0 "My mind doesn't feel like my own anymore."
 magic_backfire.0034.t:0 "Gazing Back On Me"
 magic_backfire.0034.desc:0 "The spell just doesn't work. There's no explanation for it. Everything went perfectly, but it was as if my will gave out in the final seconds.\n\nThat night I dream of a self that is not myself. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] tells me that I am not as I could be, and that my potential is greater than I know. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] shows me a mirror that reflects the things I have done. Every act of petty cruelty, callous disregard, or pointless greed. I could be better. I could be more. I think I want to believe [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim]."
 magic_backfire.0034.desc.repeat:0 "Again, my willpower gives out before the spell is cast. It is a familiar sensation and I am almost prepared for what comes next, as my dreams are once more haunted by the spectre of my more virtuous self. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] says I am not yet finished, and there is more work yet to be done. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] says [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] believes in me, and in my potential to be a better person.\n\nEach night [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] embraces me lovingly to [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] bosom, and each morning I awaken with eyes damp from crying."
 magic_backfire.0034.a:0 "Can I really become a better person?"
 magic_backfire.0034.b:0 "I will not bow to this sanctimonious specter!"
 magic_backfire.0035.t:0 "Feasting Dreams"
 magic_backfire.0035.desc:0 "As the ritual finalizes, I am struck with an odd craving for that which I cannot quite articulate. It grows more insistent with each passing hour until I finally achieve a fitful slumber.\n\nIn my dreams I attend a great feast. Roasted and honey glazed delights writhe in ecstasy on our truncheons, and I devour them with gusto. Fattened plumplings and dormice with the faces of beautiful men and women cheer for joy as they all go down my hungry gullet, one by one. The place of honor is reserved for our host, who bears my face and my voice. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] laughs heartily and grins with teeth red with meat-juice and lips stained with rich spiced wine. \n\nA toast!\n\n A toast!\n\n More!\n\nI awaken drenched in sweat, with the taste of sweet juices still rich on my tongue."
 magic_backfire.0035.desc.repeat:0 "This next night the craving returns, and I know all too well what I will dream of. The feast continues, faceless and lithely available servants of alluring shape collect dripping fat from roasting hog-things, which laugh in joy and recommend particularly delectable cuts. They say the loin is best, but if I am looking for a sample they beckon me to fetch a meaty rib or two for my delight. Our host is here again. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] wraps [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] arms around my shoulders in a hot embrace and whispers in my ear.\n\n"There is yet more for us to experience. Why deny?"\n\nWhy indeed?"
 magic_backfire.0035.a:0 "I want it all. I want everything!"
 magic_backfire.0035.b:0 "Oh [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], deliver me from seduction!"
 magic_backfire.0036.t:0 "Dreams of Avarice"
 magic_backfire.0036.desc:0 "The ritual seems to have been a success, with no obvious signs of failure or blowback.\n\nIt is only the following nights that I realize that my dabbling has opened my psyche up to an outside presence.\n\nThe specter bearing my own face takes me to the tallest peak I have ever seen, from which the entirety of Aeras spreads out below us. "Do you not see the breadth of the domain that could be yours?" [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] whispers into my ear, sending shivers up my spine.\n\n"Do you not see the smallminded fools who stand in your way? The threats to your pre-ordained authority?"\n\nI swallow nervously and nod. I do indeed see them."
 magic_backfire.0036.desc.repeat:0 "The specter of cold ambition returns to my dreams once more in the aftermath of our ritual. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] rants and raves at me, pointing out each individual failure, each mistake I have made that has denied me the power and authority which should rightfully be mine. Children, lieges, vassals, these are all threats to me and mine.\n\nThe path to my ascension lies open, and I have but to listen to the specter to begin my climb."
 magic_backfire.0036.a:0 "All the thrones of the world shall be mine!"
 magic_backfire.0036.b:0 "This is madness!"
 magic_backfire.0400.t:0 "White Flame of Revelation"
 magic_backfire.0400.desc:0 "Though the ritual succeeds, the flame refuses to die out.\n\nQuick as lightning, the searing-white flame leaps from the ritual bowl with predatory intent. I don't even have time to cover my face before it is upon me, and the world dissolves into pain and noise. The next few moments I can only recall in vague flashes.\n\n The panicked shouts of my apprentices running for the bags of sand and pots of water to quench the flame.\n\nThe hardness of the ground upon which I writhe in a desperate attempt to fight off my burning adversary.\n\nThe whispers spoken into my ear by the White Flame itself. Secrets spoken in hushed conversations and solitary confessions in front of hearths and campfires across my realm."
 magic_backfire.0400.a:0 "I'll have to remember this..."
 magic_backfire.0401.t:0 "Green Flame of Renewal"
 magic_backfire.0401.desc:0 "Though the ritual succeeds, the flame refuses to die.\n\nSpringing forth from almost-dead coals in the ritual bowl, the flame glows with an angry emerald light. Before I can even react it is upon me, swirling upon lines of arcane power. The pain is unbearable, and my acolytes shout in alarm as they run for the pots of water and bowls of sand to try and douse the supernatural flame.\n\nOddities compound in the aftermath. The burns which covered nearly my entire body rapidly fall away in the following days to reveal the softer skin of a much younger person, and my limbs feel animated with an energy I haven't felt in years!"
 magic_backfire.0401.a:0 "Youth, but does it come at a cost?"
 magic_backfire.0402.t:0 "The Firestorm Cometh"
 magic_backfire.0402.desc:0 "Desperately we work to contain our ritual, but the tower of flame only seems to continue to grow, feeding off of the ambient energies of the world around us. One of my acolytes turns, and with terror in his eyes tries to say one word.\n\n 'run'\n\nNo sooner has it passed his lips than my world disappears into white hot pain, and then nothing.\n\nThey will say that the inferno could be seen for over a hundred miles. Few in my court survived, and none without scars."
 magic_backfire.0500.t:0 "Aelvar Screams"
 magic_backfire.0500.desc:0 "As Aelvar reaches its zenith my chanting reaches its peak. However, a scream eminating from Aelvar causes me to lose control of the spell spiraling off into a random direction. Who knows where it goes."
 magic_backfire.0500.a:0 "Aelvar Wills It"
