 study_magic.0001.t:0 "A Breakthrough!"
 study_magic.0001.desc.minor:0 "I don't understand. The scrolls and tomes before me hint of powerful arcane secrets, yet I was only able to extract the most basic of concepts. As I turn a weary eye to the scattered notes strewn around my desk, I am struck by a wave of exhaustion and disappointment.\n\nI decide to stop my study at this juncture, promising to myself that I shall revisit these writings once I gain a better understanding of the subject matter."
 study_magic.0001.desc.mid:0 "After months of intense study, my research into the arcane has finally borne some fruit. Though many of the more grand insights I was seeking still elude me, I have undoubtedly managed to advance both my theoretical and practical understanding of the subject at hand.\n\nAs I put away my papers, I make sure to mark those of interest to further studies — I have found several promising leads that merit additional investigation."
 study_magic.0001.desc.major:0 "This particular study has been one full of difficulties and challenges. After many moons of meticulous work on my part however, I have finally obtained a satisfactory conclusion. The various theories and thoughts that I had previously thought as disparate have melded together in my mind to form an intricate tapestry of arcane knowledge — signifying an understanding of this field of magic that few [magi|E] of my level have achieved."

After many moons of meticulous work on my part however, I have finally obtained a satisfactory conclusion. The various theories and thoughts that I had previously thought as disparate have melded together in my mind to form an intricate tapestry of arcane knowledge — signifying a mastery over this field of magic that few have ever achieved."
 study_magic.0001.desc.epic:0 "It is done. Months of painstaking research have yielded a treasure trove of knowledge rivalling those produced by the [mayikrata|E] at its heyday. As I shakily stand up on feet that have not seen use in days, I tremble at the myriad possibilities presented by my new-found comprehension of the arcane. One thing is for sure however — [aeras|E] will never be the same."

As I shakily stand up on feet that have not seen use in days, I am ecstatic at the thought of my rapid development in [magic|E] due to the new-found information at my disposal."
 study_magic.0001.a:0 "I have learned what I can, for now."
 study_magic.0011.t:0 "A Dead End"
 study_magic.0011.desc:0 "I stand over my study table, trying to make sense of the chaotic tangle of diagrams and notes. It just doesn't make sense! The theories contained within are full of gaping holes, their implications contradict both each other and observable reality, and practical attempts to test their validity have all ended in complete failure.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that most of this work is as good as worthless."
 study_magic.0011.a:0 "My mind needs rest from this."
 study_magic.0011.b:0 "I'm so close, though! Just a little more research!"
