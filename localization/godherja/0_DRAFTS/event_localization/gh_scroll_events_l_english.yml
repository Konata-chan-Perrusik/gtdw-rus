Flanked by several guards, a cloaked and hooded figure enters the hall and makes their way towards my throne. The figure removes [great_magi.GetHerHis] cowl and addresses me directly. "Greetings [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFirstName] [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetDynasty.GetName], my name is [great_magi.GetFirstName] and I have traveled to seek an audience with the ruler of this land.

 gh_scroll.0002.desc:0 "The court falls silent as I break the seal and unfurl the scroll. After scanning the text on the scroll, I hand the scroll to [royal_magi.GetFirstName] whose eyes widen as [royal_magi.GetSheHe] reads its etched runes. After a moment, [royal_magi.GetSheHe] looks up, "My liege," [royal_magi.GetSheHe] says, "the scroll and its contents are exactly as our guest says. It is indeed a worthwhile spell."

 gh_scroll.0003.t:0 "Duel the Magi" 
 gh_scroll.0003.desc:0 "My voice echoes off of the walls as courtiers flee. My guards converge upon the lone Magi standing before me, I watch in disbelief as [great_magi.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] uses a deadly combination of advanced martial and arcane techniques to fend off each attacker with apparent ease. As my guards begin to get to their feet to reengage the intruder, I hold up my hand for them to stand down, draw my weapon, and lock eyes with the Magi."

 gh_scroll.0004.t:0 "Victory Secured"
 gh_scroll.0004.desc:0 "Sparks fly as our weapons meet, each of us locked in a battle of physical strength and willpower. I quickly notice that although [great_magi.GetFirstName] is clearly a master of the arcane arts and a capable duelist, [great_magi.GetSheHe] is clearly no match for my combined arcane and martial prowess. All I have to do is wait for an opening…then, with a parry, riposte, and a deft thrust, I draw first blood. Sensing a shift of momentum in my favor, I press forward, but the Magi easily sidesteps my advance and punishes me for it, catching me with the tip of [great_magi.GetHerHis] weapon. Wincing, I regain my bearings and unleash a series of vicious attacks that smash through [great_magi.GetHerHis] guard. Then, in a single movement, I sidestep [great_magi.GetFirstNamePossessive] next attack and press the tip of my weapon against [great_magi.GetHerHis] throat. "Yield!""
 gh_scroll.0004.a:0 "You are a worthy opponent, but I would rather you join my court than quarrel with you."
 gh_scroll.0004.b:0 "To the dungeons!"
 gh_scroll.0004.c:0 "The punishment for challenging my authority is death."


 gh_scroll.0005.t:0 "Bested in Single Combat"
 gh_scroll.0005.desc:0 "Our weapons meet in the middle with a mighty clash. I quickly realize that I am dealing with no ordinary duelist. Then, before I can react, it is all over. With [great_magi.GetHerHis] free hand, [great_magi.GetFirstName] unleashes a blast of arcane power that hits me like a battering ram, knocking the wind from my lungs and sending me sprawling to the floor. Before I can get back on my feet, I look up to the sight of [great_magi.GetFirstName] standing over me with [great_magi.GetHerHis] weapon resting just under my throat. With a wave of [great_magi.GetHerHis] hand, the scroll floats across the room and lands in [great_magi.GetHerHis] outstretched palm. Brandishing the scroll over [great_magi.GetHerHis] head, the Magi says, “You are lucky that I am feeling merciful today. Be thankful that I have chosen to spare you.” Then, before anyone can say a word, [great_magi.GetSheHe] vanishes."
 gh_scroll.0005.a:0 "I have been bested."
