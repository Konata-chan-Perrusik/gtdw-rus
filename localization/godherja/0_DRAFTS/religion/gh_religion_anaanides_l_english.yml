However, the number of souls fit to enter Anaan is very slim in number, and not all who seek the path may reach it. The only truly good people who die are the very young, who do not yet know evil, or the old, who have cleansed their souls of impure desires."

 anaanides_desc:0 "The belief that it is only possible to enter the paradise of Anaan through a lifelong journey of mental exploration and purification means that there are very few converts to the Anaanide faith. Their ultimate solution is seen by its members as a drastic, yet necessary action - the kidnapping of those too young to know sin, and raising them among the Anaanides so they may start on the path as soon as possible. Cruel it may be, but is it not a crueler fate to condemn these souls to oblivion?"
