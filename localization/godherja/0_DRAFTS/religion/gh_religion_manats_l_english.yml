 manats_religion_desc:0 "A thousand thousand generations prior, the Manats claim, the [Concept('manat_mythology','Manat Gods')|E] once walked among humanity. They taught mankind how to build cities, how to hunt, how to fight, and how to structure society. When they departed, they left behind a list of [Concept('gena_tinngir','Sacred Texts')|E] for humanity to follow their teachings. They have been transcribed again and again over the centuries, repeated in a long-dead language whose translations have been passed down by oral tradition. Although only a fraction of the original texts are said to survive, what remains is treasured by Manats as more precious than gold."

Although there are original translations passed down by oral tradition, many Manat translators attempt to decipher the original language of the gods themselves, so that they might better be able to form a society as it was in those holiest of early days."

They believe that it is the sole right of the ruler of a realm to translate the [Concept('gena_tinngir','Sacred Texts')|E], with clergy only guarding the libraries, a task they argue is so vital it cannot be distracted from by scholarly efforts. They justify this belief by referring to how the king of the gods, [Concept('manat_mythology','Relyon')|E], had supreme authority over all other gods, even the keeper of the divine library, [Concept('manat_mythology','Ashema')|E]."

Due to the large variety of interpretations of the Sacred Texts tolerated by the Mafida, they have been labelled as heretical by all other Manats, even if the majority of Mafida have similar beliefs to the Manat mainstream."
