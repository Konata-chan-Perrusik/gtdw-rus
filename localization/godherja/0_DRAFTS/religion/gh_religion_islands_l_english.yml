According to the legend passed down through generations, a young Bibloseia was spoken to one night by the spirit Sautono, promising him that immortality would be his if he killed the frightening death-king Polas-Uro in combat. Sautono warned the young boy that this was a task he would need to devote his life to, for entire armies had groveled at the feet of Polas-Uro before.\n\nBut Bibloseia was a determined soul. Through many years of training, he became an inspiring warrior, wielding a spear and a unique nine-sided shield he crafted from the finest wood and metal on his home island. Cutting down enemies like a lumberjack topples trees, Bibloseia eventually became strong enough to challenge Polas-Uro, who had kept his strength even in age. And after a duel lasting five hours, Polas-Uro was impaled through the head; the death-king was himself slain.\n\nYet when Bibloseia called upon Sautono to give him immortality, the spirit laughed. Without warning, Bibloseia was instantly turned into stone and cast deep into the earth. The devilish Sautono had given Bibloseia immortality, but not in the way that he wished..."

To avert such tragedies from occurring again, adherents regularly make offerings in the form of immense ships bearing sacrifices to the sea to appease the god, who will in return give gifts such as calm seas and bountiful harvests.
