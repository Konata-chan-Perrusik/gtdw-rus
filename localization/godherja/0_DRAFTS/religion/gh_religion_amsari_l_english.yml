 amsari_religion_adj: "Zaoranian"
 amsari_religion_adherent: "Zaoranian"
 amsari_religion_adherent_plural: "Zaoranians"
 amsari_religion_desc: "The worship of the Great God Zaoran, He of a Hundred Virtues, has persisted among the Amsari for millennia. The basic form of faith has slowly developed over the long centuries and exhorts the Righteous to seek a virtuous life and to reject dishonesty, idleness, and cruelty. The most important rituals are conducted in grand public ceremonies to which all classes of society are welcome by the caste of priests known as the [gh_frazan|E]. Broadly speaking the faith of the Zaoranians envisions the world as one great divine plan, in which each man and woman must play their ordained part and live justly by the dictates of Zaoran in order to ensure His victory over His dark son Maiya in the Last Struggle.\n\nDespite this commandment to maintain social stability, the Zaoranian faith has been wracked by its fair share of internecine struggles and massive reformations throughout history. Most recent of these came in the form of the [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E], who began preaching in the year 201 with an all encompassing vision of his people's future - one which started coming true almost immediately as they overthrew their Ran Kemsari oppressors."

 zurvan_zaoran_adherent: "Zaoranian"
 zurvan_zaoran_adherent_plural: "Zaoranians"
 zurvan_zaoran_desc: "The ancient belief in Zaoran, He of a Hundred Virtues, was practiced by the Amsari under the rule of the Kemsari. Persecution forced the faith into secrecy, with its followers adapting their worship to survive. Each community formed its own rituals and interpretations, leading to a wide array of localized practices. With no unified doctrine, the faith splintered into many forms, its teachings passed down in hidden altars and whispered prayers."

 mahndayana: "Mahndayanism" # Mainstream Tradition
 mahndayana_adj: "Mahndayana"
 mahndayana_adherent: "Zaoranian"
 mahndayana_adherent_plural: "Zaoranians"
 mahndayana_desc: "[frodbrokna|E] was the confirmation of many Zaoranians' worst fears, especially because it happened exactly when [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E] predicted their god's defeat. The people were left listless, wondering how they could possibly continue to function in a world where evil has triumphed over good. Their answer was surprisingly simple: keep functioning as if it hadn't. Many Zaoranians continue to perform the rituals and sing the songs of their ancestors, out of desperate hope that their gestures will one day drive Zaoran to prophesied victory."

 mahnda_yathekar_adj: "Mahnda Yathekar"
 mahnda_yathekar_adherent: "Yathekarian"
 mahnda_yathekar_adherent_plural: "Yathekari"
 mahnda_yathekar_desc: "Centered around a figure believed to be the reincarnation of [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E], the exact teachings of the 'False Prophet,' have been lost over the centuries. His followers, however, were said to have turned away from key aspects of mainstream Mahndayanism, placing absolute faith in their leader's divine authority."
 
 #Maybe good for secret faith system?
 daenavad: "Daenavadism" # Mainstream Tradition
 daenavad_adj: "Daenavad"
 daenavad_adherent: "Daenavadian"
 daenavad_adherent_plural: "Daenavadi"
 daenavad_desc: "Founded within the Amonnid ruling dynasty, Daenavadism extends beyond the belief that the Amsari Hiklahn should be ruled by a descendant of [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E]. It asserts that every ruling position, or any position of power, must be held by those who can directly trace their lineage to the Prophet. While no Qanamsar has ever officially adhered to Daenavad, its influence persists in the higher echelons of society within the Prophet's descendants, where the purity of one's descent is regarded as the ultimate marker of authority and legitimacy."
 
 tirazhidar: "Tahkedarism" # Mainstream Tradition
 tirazhidar_adj: "Tahkedar"
 tirazhidar_adherent: "Zaoranian"
 tirazhidar_adherent_plural: "Zaoranians"
 tirazhidar_desc: "Its adherents blame the unfaithful beyond [amsar|E] for Zaoran's recent defeat and the catastrophe brought by [frodbrokna|E], seeing it as the hand of Maiya upon the world through the actions of humans. Their doctrine rests on a strictly literal reading of specific passages from the [gh_zenda|E], verses that most scholars regard as metaphorical, including nations gathered in Zaoran's light and the purging of falsehood as direct commands rather than allegories. Salvation is not an individual pursuit but a collective duty.\n\nAn interpretation that has driven many of them toward violent actions, inclduing enacting forced conversion upon the wandering people of Amsar. To them, humanity must be brought beneath Zaoran's divine order for His triumph to be absolute. Only then will the world be made whole, and the Last Struggle at last be won."
 
 #Disappeared for a long time is gathering dust in late startdates
 mahazhadar: "Mahazhadarism"  # Tazāyan Tradition
 mahazhadar_adj: "Mahazhadar"
 mahazhadar_adherent: "Zaoranian"
 mahazhadar_adherent_plural: "Zaoranians"
 mahazhadar_desc: "Emerging in the years following [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E]'s death, Mahazhadarism persisted briefly after the [Concept('gh_amsari_rebellion','Amsari Rebellion')|E] before disappearing. Mahazhadari interpreted the Prophet's teachings not as straightforward declarations but as symbolic expressions of deeper truths. Its adherents believed that the events described for the future were not literal prophecies but abstract concepts that required thoughtful interpretation. They maintained that the future, as described by the Prophet, was not fixed but could be understood through reflection and debate."
 
 khebaranism: "Khebarānism"  # Tazāyan Tradition
 khebaranism_adj: "Khebarāna"
 khebaranism_adherent: "Khebarān"
 khebaranism_adherent_plural: "Khebarāni"
 khebaranism_desc: "Khebarāni believe that the teachings of [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E] conceal deeper truths, accessible only to those with the wisdom to perceive them. To them, the [gh_zenda|E] is layered, and what is forbidden to the ignorant may be permitted to the enlightened if it serves a higher purpose. This has led to unorthodox interpretations of religious law, where morality is dictated by wisdom rather than rigid doctrine. Khebarānism flourished for some time in Western Siral, despite facing harsh persecution from orthodox [Concept('gh_frazan','Frazani')|E], who condemn its teachings as dangerous heresy."
 
 mezrai: "Mezra'ī"
 mezrai_adj: "Mezra'ī"
 mezrai_adherent: "Mezra'īsan"
 mezrai_adherent_plural: "Mezra'īsi"
 mezrai_desc: "Originating in Lirkak in North Levan, the Mezra'īsi trace their teachings to Sarvān i-Khizrad, a man who, they claim, received a secret revelation from [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E] while passing through the region. The Prophet is said to have entrusted him with truths too complex for the simple minds of commoners, teachings meant only for those chosen to fully understand Zaoran's deeper wisdom. Rejecting the idea of writing down their secretive knowledge, the Mezra'īsi passed them orally through strict initiatory rites."
 
 hazrandanism: "Hazrandānism" # Tazāyan Tradition
 hazrandanism_adj: "Hazrandāna"
 hazrandanism_adherent: "Hazrandān"
 hazrandanism_adherent_plural: "Hazrandāni"
 hazrandanism_desc: "Once among the most popular movement following [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E]'s death and some time after the establishment of the Amsari Hiklahn, Hazrandānism rejects written scriptures, believing that they distort the eternal and adaptable nature of divine truth. To the Hazrandāni, faith must be preserved through oral tradition, as the evolution of language and personal understanding is essential to keeping its true meaning alive. Over time, the movement suffered steep decline, facing repression from the [Concept('gh_frazan','Frazani')|E], who viewed its teachings as a direct threat to the integrity of the Prophet's message. Now, only small and scattered communities continue to uphold its traditions."
 
 ihzafeh: "Ihzāfehism"  # Tazāyan Tradition
 ihzafeh_adj: "Ihzāfeh"
 ihzafeh_adherent: "Ihzāfehsan"
 ihzafeh_adherent_plural: "Ihzāfehsi"
 ihzafeh_desc: "The Ihzāfehsi arose in defiance of what they saw as the corruption of society, particularly among the ruling elite and the [gh_frazan|E] clergy, whom they viewed as decadent and estranged from true faith. Rejecting rigid doctrine, they hold that personal interpretation is the purest means of understanding Zaoran's will, elevating direct spiritual experience over the authority of religious institutions. To the Ihzāfeh, faith is not bound by hierarchy, but by the sincerity of one's devotion."
 
 nashadism: "Nashadism" # Mainstream Tradition
 nashadism_adj: "Nashadi"
 nashadism_adherent: "Nashadan"
 nashadism_adherent_plural: "Nashadi"
 nashadism_desc: "Nashadism properly emerged in the wake of the [gh_massacre_of_the_ten_heirs|E]. However, many Zaoranian thinkers such as Arvashdān Izhākhet, along with the local population, had already begun questioning the long-held belief that legitimacy passed solely through blood. Dissatisfaction with both past and present rulers led them to argue that struggle and righteousness solely determined a ruler's right to rule.\n\nIronically, in an effort to gain further traction across [amsar|E] and strengthen their political position, they rallied behind Nashad. Who was the alleged surviving son of Qanamsar Parashād's eldest heir, and rejected the 'usurper' Qanamsara Tōvah. To the Nashadi, the rightful line of succession passed through Radesh and his son Nashad, whom they believed was destined to lead them to prophesied victory. Even after his death and the failure of the [gh_emerald_rebellion|E], his most ardent followers insisted that he had hidden away a child who would one day reclaim his birthright."
 
 elaahism: "Elaahism" # Belrukian Tradition
 elaahism_adj: "Elaahi
 elaahism_adherent: "Elaahan"
 elaahism_adherent_plural: "Elaahi"
 elaahism_desc: "The Elaahi are one of the few Amsari sects that maintained their own beliefs for centuries after the [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E]'s death and the formation of the Hiklahn. They reject the very story of creation and the [gh_amsari_story_first_struggle|E] as described in the [gh_zenda|E]. Believing Belruk's actions to have been misunderstood and instead that Iralya was an agent of Maiya, leading the [gh_amsari_first_dreamers|E] astray from Zaoran. As such, they consider The Prophet to have reinforced a corrupted version of faith, one that fails to recognize the true struggle against deception and falsehood. The Elaahi hold that true faith in Zaoran requires rejecting the lies imposed upon the world since the First Struggle."

 amsari_interpretative_tradition_name: "Interpretative Tradition"
 amsari_mainstream_doctrine_name: "Mahndayāni Tradition"
 amsari_mainstream_doctrine_desc: "The Mahndayāni Tradition is the mainstream understanding of the Zenda and the Sazān-e Mahndāzi, as taught by the Frazani of the Unij-e Kahderz and other prominent centers of learning that have developed over the centuries. It regards the Prophecy as the literal unfolding of the future and the words of the Prophet as absolute and final, rejecting deviations that compromise the established moral and spiritual framework.\n\nWhile its adherents allows interpretation, it does so strictly within the bounds of tradition and only within Frazani institutions under the guidance of the most learned scholars. Any radical deviation from their interpretation is viewed as heretical and subject to repression by the Frazani."
 
 amsari_nezrakh_doctrine_name: "Nezrākh'si Tradition"
 amsari_nezrakh_doctrine_desc: "Flourishing within the traditionally unstructured Zaoranian movements of the early days of the Hiklahn, as well as in earlier times, this broad category encompasses various faiths that emphasize personal interpretation of the holy texts and encourage spiritual discussion at all levels of society.\n\nThis has traditionally led its adherents to a more tolerant and open approach regarding differing interpretations. While the mainstream has rarely been openly violent toward what it considers astray interpretations of the Zenda, it has often viewed them with suspicion and sought to curb their influence."
 
 amsari_belrukan_doctrine_name: "Belrukan Tradition"
 amsari_belrukan_doctrine_desc: "The Belruki reject the traditional account of creation as expressed in the Zenda, believing that the truth of Zaoran has been obscured since the First Struggle. They place special importance on Belruk, whom they see as misjudged. To them, those who believe or teach the traditional account of creation are heretics who must be eliminated for true faith to prevail."

 amsari_vehuj_doctrine_name: "Vehuj Tradition"
 amsari_vehuj_doctrine_desc: "The Vehuj Tradition believes that divine truth must remain fluid, passed through oral tradition. The Zenda is a living memory, evolving through speech and the wisdom of generations. Anything else severs faith from its fluid and ever-evolving essence."
 
 amsari_suhdrash_doctrine_name: "Suhdrash Tradition"
 amsari_suhdrash_doctrine_desc: "Suhdrash is a broad term that has historically been used to describe any that considers its interpretation of the Zenda as the sole and absolute truth.
