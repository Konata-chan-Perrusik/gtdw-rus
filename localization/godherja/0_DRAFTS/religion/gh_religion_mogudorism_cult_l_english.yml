While the faith has been permanently proscribed by the Kathuni state due to their involvement in a coup attempt in the eighth century IS, every attempt to burn their teachings has proven ultimately futile; copies of the Chaining Manual and its supplemental volumes have a way of reappearing under mysterious circumstances."
