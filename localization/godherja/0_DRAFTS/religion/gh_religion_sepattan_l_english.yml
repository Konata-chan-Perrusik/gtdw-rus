 sepattan_twin_gods_doctrine_desc: "Those that walk the Path of the Twin Gods believe in living in harmony with nature and reject all forms of outsider civilization and their ‘innovations’. They see [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] as a mad innovator who sought to destroy the Nattanan peoples harmony with nature and the unity the people had. Followers seek to persecute all those who see the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] as traitors to the true Path."
  
 sepattan_korlacu_doctrine_name: "Path of Korlacu"
 sepattan_korlacu_doctrine_desc: "Those who walk the Path of Korlacu believe in industry, forging and fire as Korlacu advocated. They see the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] as foolish backwards gods who betrayed Korlacu when he tried to improve the Nattanan peoples lot destroying their unity. Followers seek to persecute all those who see [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] as a traitor of the true Path."
  
 sepattan_twin_gods_men_doctrine_name: "Path of the Magi"
 sepattan_twin_gods_men_doctrine_desc: "Those that walk the Path of Magi reject the divinity of the Twin Gods and Korlacu, instead saying that they were powerful magi who helped drive off outsiders and establish a new way of living, before internal strife caused a schism. One side now claims that [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] destroyed the unity, others claim the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] destroyed the unity, those who follow this Path try take lessons from all three Gods and wish to reunite the people and move on from this strife."

 sepattan_no_twin_gods_doctrine_name: "Path of The Godless"
 sepattan_no_twin_gods_doctrine_desc: "Those that walk the Path of the Godless believe that the Twin Gods and Korlacu are legends based on fiction. The myth that the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] betrayed Korlacu, or that [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] betrayed the Twin Gods, does not really matter to these followers. The Gods were created in the past to help reinforce traditions necessary for the Nattanan way of life; knowing this, we can believe whatever we want."

 sepattan_death_king_doctrine_name: "Path of the Death King"
 sepattan_death_king_doctrine_desc: "Path of the Death King is tread by those that venerate Akkharadahamma the Undying, the Path of the Death King is a reviled path dedicated to the restoration of its dread master, and the reawakening of his dark rule over Nattanan.

They see [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] as a mad innovator who sought to destroy the Nattanan peoples harmony with nature and the unity the people had. Followers seek to persecute all those who see the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] as traitors to the true Path. Where they differ from the Path of the Twin Gods is in the belief that the Twin God's return to Nattanan periodically as babies, to lead the Nattanan people."

Adherents view outsiders as melancholic and misguided souls and believe that it is the duty of the faithful to convince them to walk the middle path. Despite this openness however, the Nathanalmics continue to be wary of ideas outside the norm, out of fear that these may ignite anew the [Concept('great_betrayal','tragedies')|E] that passed before."

Thus, while they are respected by all Nattanan, adherents mostly keep to their own within the deepest reaches of the jungle. \n\nGotharnalmics also shun war and violence as a corrupting force that caused [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] to fall and believe that the only time it is permitted by the Twin Gods is when it is done to protect one’s own."

 korlenalmic_desc:0 "A newer sect of the Korlonalmic heresy, the Korlenalmic or Fiery Path was founded by a group of Nattanan dissidents that discovered records of the [fire_path|E]. Facing persecution, the new sect then fled to the east, where they encountered stewards of the Thuantyan Sraidyan, Kathunians who believed in the sanctity of creating lasting works. The Korlenalmics eventually adopted much of this worldview and held that by innovating and creating great works, they would be raised up to serve directly under Korlacu, who would then lead them to create a better world for all.

However, the [twin_deceivers|E] betrayal resulted in the fall of Korlacu, and his followers' banishment to the [Glossary( 'Chan Kyawkorlacu', 'GH_CHAN_KYAWKORLACU_GLOSS' )] - the northwestern mountains of Kharadan. There the sect would adopt a more radical view of magical research, influenced in part by the nearby worshippers of Sarvat, the Kashiryan god of knowledge."
