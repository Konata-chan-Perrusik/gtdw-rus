 sepattan_religion_desc:0 "The Sepattan (or 'True Ways') are a series of similar faiths that all view the outside world as backward. They believe that the twin gods Tarfal and Jerniem created mankind, and gave them dominion over all animals and fruiting plants to nurture and watch over, but never to enslave. \n\n At first, Man followed these commands and prospered, thriving within the great jungle. But a great demon Korlacu tempted the greatest of the clans with power, whispering that by enslaving nature to their will, they could create new lands and beings — becoming like the gods themselves. \n\n This has led to humanity's banishment from the great jungle, forever barred from salvation, but promised with reconciliation by staying true to the path first taught by the Twin Gods."

Adherents view outsiders as melancholic and misguided souls and believe that it is the duty of the faithful to convince them to walk the middle path. Despite this openness however, the Nathanalmics continue to be wary of ideas outside the norm, out of fear that these may ignite anew the [Concept('great_betrayal','tragedies')|E] that passed before."

The path's faithful have a long history of guarding against those who would seek to drive them from the Cloud Forests of [Glossary( 'Chan Kyawkorlacu', 'GH_CHAN_KYAWKORLACU_GLOSS' )] - granting them a great zeal that serves as a shield against the temptation to follow in the ways of their [Concept('great_betrayal','heathen ancestors')|E]."

Thus, while they are respected by all Nattanan, adherents mostly keep to their own within the deepest reaches of the jungle. \n\nGotharnalmics also shun war and violence as a corrupting force that caused [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] to fall and believe that the only time it is permitted by the Twin Gods is when it is done to protect one’s own."

 korlenalmic_adj:0 "Korlenalmic"
 korlenalmic_adherent:0 "Korlenalmi"
 korlenalmic_adherent_plural:0 "Korlenalmics"
 korlenalmic_desc:0 "A newer sect of the Korlonalmic heresy, the Korlenalmic or Fiery Path was founded by a group of Nattanan dissidents that discovered records of the [fire_path|E]. Facing persecution, the new sect then fled to the east, where they encountered stewards of the Thuantyan Sraidyan, Kathunians who believed in the sanctity of creating lasting works. The Korlenalmics eventually adopted much of this worldview and held that by innovating and creating great works, they would be raised up to serve directly under Korlacu, who would then lead them to create a better world for all.

 korlonalmic_desc:0 "For as long as the Twin Gods and Followers of the Way have existed, there have been those who reject it and seek the Korlonalmic or [fire_path|E]. However, the [twin_deceivers|E] betrayal resulted in the fall of Korlacu, and his followers' banishment to the [Glossary( 'Chan Kyawkorlacu', 'GH_CHAN_KYAWKORLACU_GLOSS' )] - the northwestern mountains of Kharadan. There the sect would adopt a more radical view of magical research, influenced in part by the nearby worshippers of Sarvat, the Kashiryan god of knowledge."
