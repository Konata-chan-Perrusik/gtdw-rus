 sepattan_religion_desc:0 "The Sepattan (or 'True Ways') are a series of similar faiths that all view the outside world as backward. They believe that the twin gods Tarfal and Jerniem created mankind, and gave them dominion over all animals and fruiting plants to nurture and watch over, but never to enslave. \n\n At first, Man followed these commands and prospered, thriving within the great jungle. But a great demon Korlacu tempted the greatest of the clans with power, whispering that by enslaving nature to their will, they could create new lands and beings — becoming like the gods themselves. \n\n This has led to humanity's banishment from the great jungle, forever barred from salvation, but promised with reconciliation by staying true to the path first taught by the Twin Gods."

 #Sepattan Sacred Paths

 sepattan_twin_gods_doctrine_name: "Path of The Twin Gods"
 sepattan_twin_gods_doctrine_desc: "Followers of the Path of The Twin Gods believe in living in harmony with nature and rejecting all forms of outsider civilization. They see [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] as an arch betrayer of the path and persecute all who follow him seeing the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] as arch betrayers of the path."
  
 sepattan_korlacu_doctrine_name: "Path of Korlacu"
 sepattan_korlacu_doctrine_desc: "Followers of the Path of Korlacu believe in industry, forging and fire as Korlacu advocated. They see the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] as arch betrayers of the path and seek to persecute all those who follow them seeing [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] as a arch betrayer of the path."
  
 sepattan_twin_gods_men_doctrine_name: "Path of the Magi"
 sepattan_twin_gods_men_doctrine_desc: "The Path of Magi reject the divinity of the Twin God's and Korlacu, instead followers say the they were powerful magi who helped drive off outsiders and establish a way of living, before internal strife caused a schism. One side now claims that [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] destroyed the unity, others claim the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] destroyed the unity, those who follow this path try take lessons from all three Gods and wish to reunite the people and move on from this strife."

 sepattan_no_twin_gods_doctrine_name: "Path of The Godless"
 sepattan_no_twin_gods_doctrine_desc: "The Path of The Godless believe that the Twin God's and Korlacu are legend based off fiction. The belief that the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] betrayed Korlacu, or [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] betrayed the Twin Gods does not really matter to these followers. The Gods were created in the past to help reinforce traditions necessary for the Nattanan way of life; knowing this we can believe whatever we want."

 sepattan_death_king_doctrine_name: "Path of the Death King"
 sepattan_death_king_doctrine_desc: "The Path of the Death King is followed by those who worship Akkharadahamma the Undying and seek to assert his beliefs over all of Nattanan. This places them in conflict with all other Paths and is often stamped out wherever followers of the path appear."
  
 sepattan_reincarnate_twin_gods_doctrine_name: "Path of Twin Gods Incarnate"
 sepattan_reincarnate_twin_gods_doctrine_desc: "The Path of The Twin Gods Incarnate believe in living in harmony with nature and rejecting all forms of outsider civilization. They also see [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] as an arch betrayer of the path and persecute all who follow him seeing the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] as arch betrayers of the path. Where they differ from the Path of the Twin Gods is in the belief that the Twin God's return to Nattanan periodically as babies, to lead the Nattanan people."
 
 sepattan_reincarnate_korlacu_doctrine_name: "Path of Korlacu Incarnate"
 sepattan_reincarnate_korlacu_doctrine_desc: "The Path of Korlacu Incarnate believe in industry, forging and fire as Korlacu advocated. They see the [Concept('twin_deceivers','Twin Gods')|E] as arch betrayers of the path and seek to persecute all those who follow them seeing [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] as a arch betrayer of the path.

Adherents view outsiders as melancholic and misguided souls and believe that it is the duty of the faithful to convince them to walk the middle path. Despite this openness however, the Nathanalmics continue to be wary of ideas outside the norm, out of fear that these may ignite anew the [Concept('great_betrayal','tragedies')|E] that passed before."

Thus, while they are respected by all Nattanan, adherents mostly keep to their own within the deepest reaches of the jungle. \n\nGotharnalmics also shun war and violence as a corrupting force that caused [Concept('great_betrayal','Korlacu')|E] to fall and believe that the only time it is permitted by the Twin Gods is when it is done to protect one’s own."

 korlenalmic_desc:0 "A newer sect of the Korlonalmic heresy, the Korlenalmic or Fiery Path was founded by a group of Nattanan dissidents that discovered records of the [fire_path|E]. Facing persecution, the new sect then fled to the east, where they encountered stewards of the Thuantyan Sraidyan, Kathunians who believed in the sanctity of creating lasting works. The Korlenalmics eventually adopted much of this worldview and held that by innovating and creating great works, they would be raised up to serve directly under Korlacu, who would then lead them to create a better world for all.

However, the [twin_deceivers|E] betrayal resulted in the fall of Korlacu, and his followers' banishment to the [Glossary( 'Chan Kyawkorlacu', 'GH_CHAN_KYAWKORLACU_GLOSS' )] - the northwestern mountains of Kharadan. There the sect would adopt a more radical view of magical research, influenced in part by the nearby worshippers of Sarvat, the Kashiryan god of knowledge."
