Even further, the Amaghean Aagiokrata holds that Magi can transcend to an even higher plane of existence than the other gods and be ever closer to Arnaz the "Great Ancestor" and rule eternally from heavenly paradise. Warriors are still more often exalted, though the faith emphasizes that this is through showing "aspects of Magi" and that they will rarely, if ever, be able to rise quite as high as those with the gift.

What is known is that the oldest found piece of Aversarian writing, the Drakánoramonicar, was created by the faith's ancient leaders to codify their faith.\n\nDrakánorix Aagiokrata worships the dragons of ancient Aversaria, deifying them as beings of pure [magic|E] and divinity, sent to the world by a forgotten being to rule man. While extremely disconnected and spread across much of the world (cults being found as far as [sarradon|E]), the faith nonetheless dominated much of what is now the Imperial Isle, Etepezea, and the Shattered Sea. It would remain a pillar of Aversarian society even after the formation of the [aversarinas_aagiokratia|E], only falling to the wayside after the [war_of_the_thousand_dragons|E]. Ironically, they would serve the Imperial faction in the Civil War, their long-running hatred of Aersodiaxianism throwing them alongside the Aagiokrata. After their victory, Lethigianex would slaughter all remaining dragons, and those remaining cultists with them. The final high priest of the Dragon Cults would attempt a final uprising under Aautokratia Maklea, in the midst of her purges, and would be flayed and nailed to the wall of her palace with the desecrated horns of dragons."

Part of his initiatives were the subduing of the Zaragett, masters of water magics who had lived in the area from time immemorial and had fiercely resisted the initial Aversarian conquest. The result was the Zaragett Aagiokrata, a faith that elevates the [magi|E] priesthood to a position of supreme power over both the temporal and spiritual worlds. Furthermore, designated god-kings were to serve as high priests, placing them above the rest of the priesthood and rule over the faithful as incarnates of the Seamother and Moonfather. Typically the reigning Aautokratir of Aversaria is held to be the god-king of the Zaragett, though in recent times a great many warlords have taken to making use of the title in the pursuit of ever greater power."

Composed of the vilest [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] [magi|E], the Black Practitioners, part of the Black Fraternity, dedicate themselves to one goal only: the casting of the Kusnamenoi, the spell to warp the world and create for themselves a new paradise above it all.\n\nHaving aroused moral distaste even amongst fellow Aversarians, the Black Practitioners are forced to lay low, their influence mostly concentrated in isolated villages and settlements where they have consolidated their power following the Aversarian collapse. In these villages, no Gods are known but the Magi; these conditions have given way to an acquisitive system of worship focusing on whichever Magus arises as the strongest."

 red_star_desc:0 "Having seen the great red comet that foretold the Worldeater, some among the followers of Aersodiax concluded that it was a sign. The Worldeater, they claimed, was the 'First Herald', one of ten great beasts that would precede the return of Aersodiax, risen from death to punish those who betrayed him. Considering themselves the watchers for the end times, their secretive meetings have gradually expanded the number of Heralds, having reached the number 8 when [frodbrokna|E] devastated the world. Seeing what was surely the beginning of the end, priests rushed to declare the last two Heralds, with Aeschraes and Axiaotheia as the most common choices for the dubious honorific, though others have also become candidates, including the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E], Aexionarax, Cenware, along with many more.\n\nThough it might normally be expected of such a faith to consolidate around a single message, the imminent apocalypse has rendered such quibbling worthless, and the worshipers of the Red Star are instead devoted to enjoying what little time they have left in the form of endless celebrations and orgies, taking what they still can of life before their long-dead master returns to avenge their ancient sin."

 militant_cliques_desc:0 "The Militant Cliques are an [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] cult originating from within its Legions based primarily around the worship of the Agionist Saint Sansia (as the embodiment of strategic genius) and of Saint Eos (as the embodiment of martial perfection).\n\nThe Saints had many sympathizers (and outright followers) within the Legions, and in the recovery from the Agionist Rebellions there was no political will to attempt to dislodge them from within the otherwise loyal Legions. As such, worship of the Saints has always been seen as somewhat controversial yet extremely common, and most soldiers carry icons of Sansia or Eos as good luck charms even if they do not consider themselves faithful.\n\nSome Legionnaires have gone so far as to venerate them both solely as two halves of the Purest, and almost all veteran Legionnaires in Aversaria have historically considered themselves in some way associated to these beliefs."

 five_hundred_desc:0 "The Five Hundred Paths of Katharitos come from the same origin as the Katharites, both dedicated to the veneration of Saint Katharitos. But unlike their Agionist brethren, the Five Hundred-Pathers have devoted themselves to radical pacifism. They believe that no man should take the life of a living thing, or use anything that was not freely offered to them from [aeras|E]. Many of them interpret that tenet as a ban against wearing clothes made from cultivated textiles, animal hides, or metal armor, and are most identifiable by their ritual nudity.\n\nDespite their nonaggressive nature, they have earned plenty of ire from both the Agionists and the Aversarians. They are condemned as heretics and deviants of the lowest form, and they are frequently harassed and killed when making pilgrimages to places important in Katharitos' life. But that does not stop them from practicing their faith, nor does it deter new recruits."

As such, adherents sought to create the perfect Magi above all else, with some resorting to extreme methods ranging from marriage amongst one's own family to purging the impure, often to the detriment and horror of their own population."

Adherents often either lock themselves in their towers devoting their time to research, in pursuit of learning more about the intricacies of [magic|E] and perfecting it, or work on turning [aversaria|E] into the ideal magocracy. Though derided as ambitious pretenders with limited legitimate skills by some, declaring oneself for the cult is seen as a showing of strength among the powerful (and not so powerful) Magi nobles."

For proving their Purity they ascended from this world, joining the Purest in divinity for eternity.\n\nTheir teachings of Blood Veneration and self-sacrifice are honoured by the many noble families that still trace their lineage to the Five, preserving their legacy through peace and the continual rule of only those blessed with Purity. While the [aversarinas_aagiokratia|E] at large frowned upon this blatant heresy, generations of Governors found coexistence the most profitable, stable course of action."
