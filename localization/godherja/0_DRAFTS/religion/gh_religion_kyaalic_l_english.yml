They regard it to be where all the world's creatures were born, and thus, all beings bear a splinter of divinity.\n\nSome of the Kyaali can perform rituals to harness this splinter, allowing them to wear the skin of any creature to assume their shape, with particular reverence given to those who manage to wear the [kyaldzakaxi|E] — fearsome creatures that are hunted in the [kyalmuku|E], or Godhunt."
