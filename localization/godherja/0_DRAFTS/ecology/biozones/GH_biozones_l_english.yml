 generic_intro_desc:90 "We set out into the wilderness of #BOL [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('temporary_hunt_biozone_variable').GetFlagName,'_name'))]#!, excited for the hunt ahead of us. After weeks of handling the boring minutae of organizing the hunt itself, as well as details such as supplies and transport, we are finally in nature and at peace.\n\nNow all that is left to do is actually pick our quarry. It will take a few hours to reach a spot far enough from civilization as to be worth screening for trails, but a pleasant walk in the great outdoors will surely serve as a good warm up to the hunt itself."
 
 ## KALATHIPSOMI ##

 kalathipsomi_name:90 "Kalathipsomi"
 kalathipsomi_intro_desc:90 "Away from the bustling orchards, fields and villages nestled along the great rivers of #BOL Kalathipsomi#! lies a profoundly ancient, untouched wilderness that captivates any that visit. One must be careful, for it is incredibly easy to get lost here, and the wilds are vast enough that civilization may not be near for hundreds of leagues.\n\nThe game is, predictably, without peer. Everything from the common stag to semi-mythical, ferocious monsters can be found here. Though it may seem like a hunter's paradise, one must tread with caution, as it is quite easy to become the hunted in these woods."
 kalathipsomi_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The twin valleys of the immense Pathos and Koprolos rivers are home to some of the densest, most verdant temperate forests on all of Aeras. Though thousands of years of agricultural expansion have left vast tracts of farmland like scars across the land, the majority of #BOL Kalathipsomi#! is still dominated by practically impenetrable primordial forests that allow for an incredibly diverse and endemic ecosystem."
 
 ## HEARTWOOD ##

 kalath_old_growth_name:90 "The Heartwood"
 kalath_old_growth_intro_desc:90 "For days we have thought we were in the wilds. Long has it been since we last saw a settlement, or even another person, and nearly all around us in every direction is wilderness that stretches beyond the horizon. But once we reached the [Glossary('Heartwood','kalath_old_growth_encyclopedia_desc')],  we finally understood our mistake.\n\nMeadows surround the primordial forest's edge, where roots and timber creep across the dirt and wrap like tendrils around the trees in such a way that we can hardly see more than several steps into the woods. Despite it being midday, the understory of the forest is dark enough that my companions have already prepared a lantern. As we step into the wood, the trees seems to turn around us, changing the feeling in the air, as if this dark and mysterious forest is welcoming us deeper."
 kalath_old_growth_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Heartwood#! is a primeval forest that has stood south of the Pathos River longer than recorded history. The evergreen forest houses trees found across [Glossary('Kalathipsomi','kalathipsomi_encyclopedia_desc')], though the oldest in the Heartwood's roots have grown so large and rigid that locals say the trees almost never leave the wood. Some scholars believe this forest was the first to grow in Kalathipsomi, though there are many disagreements upon its exact age.\n\nMuch of the Heartwood is near impenetrable, dense woodland. The canopy lets little light through to the forest floor, where the massive and unending roots of the forest block most movement through the wood. At night, the forest is ablaze with light from fireflies, as well as spores that dance across the trees under moonlight. It is said that all creatures and trees in Kalathipsomi will visit the Heartwood during their migrations, though scholars have been unable to determine why."
 
 ## DELTA ##

 pathos_delta_name:90 "Pathos Delta"
 pathos_delta_intro_desc:90 "Every step so far into the [Glossary('Pathos Delta','pathos_delta_encyclopedia_desc')] has been with deliberation and caution. While the locals said we had little to fear as long as we followed the trees, it is hard not to worry about accidentally falling to your death. Regardless of the small panic each of us feel when the ground gives a little, it is difficult to not gawk at the forest's beauty. The thick, mint colored lichen grows all around us, with colorful sprouts of fungi spreading out across the tree barks and roots. A gentle mist hangs in the airabove us, giving the flora a shine through the scattered beams of sunshine that managed to breach the dense canopy.\n\nWe climb across a rocky stream and breathe in the brisk air as salmon jump through the water beneath us. Even if we do not manage to find our quarry, our time here shall surely be memorable."
 pathos_delta_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Pathos Delta#! is the name for the large temperate rainforest and scattered bogs that fill the Bay of Swords and straddle much of the Pathos River. Weather here tends to be cool and mild year round, with a long growing season and a near constant rain sprinkle. The rainforests primarily consist of spruce and fir closer to the rivers and coast that quickly begins to intermix with vast swathes of evergreen red cedar at higher elevations. While most of the understory is covered in a thick layer of lichen and ferns, the moist climate proves a perfect habitat for fungi which grows throughout the rainforest in abundance.\n\nDespite the region's beauty and abundance of food, settling the backwoods has long been considered treacherous. The limestone soil has poor drainage for the delta and sediments coming down from the mountains, and this has created a series of craggy cave networks that stretch from the delta to the Sulzegg Basin. It is not uncommon for adventurers hunting the [Glossary('Pathos Lymrill','animal_type_lymrill_encyclopedia_desc')], or settlers seeking a new home, to find themselves tumbling down a deep cavern due to a sink hole they hadn't seen."

 ## BASIN ##

 sulzegg_basin_name:90 "Kepyran Basin"
 sulzegg_basin_intro_desc:90 "We've climbed atop a jagged outcropping that overlooks the [Glossary('Kepyran Basin','sulzegg_basin_encyclopedia_desc')], and breathe in the crisp, cool air. It's near impossible to not feel relaxed looking out into the swaying forests and fields as a gentle breeze gusts past. The green in the leaves, and the blue in the water, seems sharper than I've seen before, and the fauna more at peace. Scattered farms and settlements stick out across the basin like minor landmarks, and we set out on our hunt with excitement fresh in our hearts."
 sulzegg_basin_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Kepyran Basin#! is primarily known for its bountiful crops, pristine lakes, and gorgeous vistas. While much of the region remains heavily forested with sugar pine and black oak close to the mountains, as well as trails of redwood that have moved from the coasts, the long grass prairies nearer the crystal clear lake waters are some of the most fertile fields on the [Concept('the_continent', 'Shattered Coast')|E]. Much of the beaches are as well, with many types of watercresses found only along the Kepyran lake shores. The most common fauna are often beavers, and many locals claim the longest-running war in Aeras is that between the beavers and settlements attempting to remove their dams throughout the region's watershed."

 ## FORESTS ##

 kalath_redwoods_name:90 "Laodantine Forests"
 kalath_redwoods_intro_desc:90 "The awe-inducing redwoods that dominate [Glossary('Laodantine Forests','kalath_redwoods_encyclopedia_desc')] are certainly a sight to behold, growing to such staggering heights that even ancient oak trees look like measly weeds in comparison. If I crane my neck and look at the immense canopy hanging several hundred feet above us, I can just about make out all kinds of movement among the leaves, the creatures producing them ranging from colorful birds to giant beetles.\n\nLuckily for us, the undergrowth — though present, mostly in the form of large ferns — is sparse and easily navigable, with only the occasional colossal root approaching anything resembling an obstacle. The trek here should be pleasant, though getting the canopy's more elusive residents to come down will definitely be tricky."
 kalath_redwoods_encyclopedia_desc:90 "Though populations of colossal redwood trees are present in scattered pockets across [Glossary('Kalathipsomi','kalathipsomi_encyclopedia_desc')], nowhere do they dominate the biosphere as much as in the northern half of the peninsula. The shade cast by their vast canopies means that few other tree species are able to establish a foothold underneath, but their treetops also serve as a distinct ecosystem in and of themselves, with an incredible variety of birds, small mammals and giant insects spending their entire lifetimes rarely (if ever) descending from their leafy abode."

 ## HILLS ##

 southern_kalath_name:90 "Dreaming Hills"
 southern_kalath_intro_desc:90 "We've made camp along a sloped hillside deep amongst the [Glossary('Dreaming Hills','southern_kalath_encyclopedia_desc')]. The hills, rocky cliffs, and thick lines of trees surround us bring out a surprising calmness, as if the wilderness around us truly does slumber.\n\nWe plan to head further into the forests at first light, though the last village told us of a nearby hot spring and it would not surprise me if the others want to make a detour for the relaxation. Still, we shouldn't linger for long or we might lose track of our quarry."
 southern_kalath_encyclopedia_desc:90 "South of the Kalathipsomian mountains lie the #BOL Dreaming Hills#!, a region of temperate meadows, thick forests, and awe inspiring geysers. The jagged rock formations that dot the countryside have also formed many, warm waterfalls and cascades along the waterways. While much of the fine lands along the rivers have been turned to farm, the bountiful forests that ride the rocky hills towards the mountains still hold an abundance of fauna and flora. All trees found throughout the surrounding forests can be found all the way up to the tree line, as many are said to journey through the warm valleys on their paths through the forests. Wildfires have long been common further inland, though the environment seems to have specifically adapted to this.\n\nSome scholars believe a great caldera slumbers beneath the mountains, as many geysers and hot springs can be found throughout the hills."

 ## VALLEY ##

 knokidbes_name:90 "Knokidbes Valley"
 knokidbes_intro_desc:90 "We have trudged through the [Glossary('Knokidbes Valley','knokidbes_encyclopedia_desc')] for what feels like weeks, though it has certainly been far less. The deep mud soaks my legs past the calf, and continues to drag us down with every step we take furher into the wilds. Much of the rolling, grassy hills south of the forests we've completely avoided, primarily because of locals telling us there's little there besides grass and more mud. One of my companions joked that we may have a better time using a boat to travel through the valley, and I am half tempted to agree."
 knokidbes_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Knokidbes Valley#! is a relatively untamed expanse of deeply mudded hills, moors, and forests that stretch from the southern Kalathipsomian mountains toward the Bay of Pathos. Due to the regions unique position— taking in run off from the [Glossary('Kepyran Basin','sulzegg_basin_encyclopedia_desc')], as well as overflowing tides from the nearby Zarrignian and Eramasic Rivers, the Knokidbes grasslands are quite treacherous and remains near unnavigatable for much of the year, and are little more than mudflats outside of the cold season. Many blackwater rivers coarse through the cypress and oak forests, contributing to the mud though marginally compared to the lowlands further south.\n\nThe nearby rivers also helped to form the number of barrier islands in the Eramasic Delta. These barrier islands are known to support a large number of carnivorous plants, such as Maklea's Wasptrap, though some can be found on the mainland coasts."

 ## HIGHLANDS ##

 migraddar_name:90 "Psychrassan Highlands"
 migraddar_intro_desc:90 "The further we've travelled into the forests from the [Glossary('Pathos Delta','pathos_delta_encyclopedia_desc')], towns have grown farther and farther apart. It's been nearly five days since we passed the last. As the wood turns to thick, white-barked pine and the forest floor grows covered in thistle and cones, we know we've finally reached the [Glossary('Psychrassan Highlands','migraddar_encyclopedia_desc')]. Harsh wind bites at us, rolling down from the mountains beyond the trees, and I can't help but tighten my clothes around me. The stoic wilderness around us does not seem to mind the cold wind.\n\nA loud rumbling echoes through the wood against the crunching of wood as some, large beasts moves through the trees, though it's impossible to tell from where. We're not likely to find respite in warm bed and food any time soon, so I hope we packed enough supplies for the journey."
 migraddar_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Psychrassan Highlands#! are a rugged series of heavily forested foothills that cut across the landscape toward the Black Pass and the Iron Spires further north. These dense forests have long been considered a rural backwater — thick, rocky forests with little in raw minerals and inaccessible for most due to the megafauna and avalanches. The treacherous terrain leading to the Black Pass and Iron Spires is incredibly difficult to traverse without knowledge or a guide, and what few towns and villages exist here are often remarked as the edge of civilization due to the deep wilds that lay beyond the towering mountains."

 ## MAYIKRATA ##

 mayikprolollan_name:90 "Mayikrata"
 mayikprolollan_intro_desc:90 "The [mayikrata|E] and the surrounding [Glossary('mountains','mayikprolollan_encyclopedia_desc')] are truly a sight to behold from a distance. Tinted blue and reaching impossibly high into the sky, the snowy peaks are crowned by clouds, one of the less tall ones being the throne upon which the colossal academy sits. Though quite beautiful, it is also foreboding when one realizes that we will be climbing these very same mountains soon enough.\n\nEver since the main route to the structure has fallen into disrepair, visitors have been forced to make due with a confusing series of treacherous, difficult trails. Though we might not be heading into the academy itself, the surrounding terrain will prove a massive challenge nonetheless."
 mayikprolollan_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The mountains atop which the [mayikrata|E] is perched are some of the tallest and most inaccessible in the world. The hostile environment supports only scant plantlife, and animals are equally as scarce, most being airborne predators that hunt in the surrounding lowlands instead. In addition, centuries of activity by the [Concept('mayikprolollans','Mayikprolollan')|E] itself have resulted in a large population of feral mutants and spirits in the area."
 
 ## ETEPEZEA ##

 etepezea_name:90 "Etepezea"
 etepezea_intro_desc:90 "Mainland [Glossary('Etepezea','etepezea_encyclopedia_desc')] was never an especially attractive location for the casual hunter, and it is not at all hard to see why. Though the coast may be relatively pleasant, almost all of the local game worth hunting instead inhabits the mountainous, sun-baked interior. As we delve deeper inland, the terrain not only becomes increasingly steep and uneven, but the hardy, evergreen shrubbery becomes almost equally untraversable.\n\nThe endless maquis not only massively impedes movement, but also conceals arguably the greatest danger of the peninsula - snakes. [Glossary('Etepezea','etepezea_encyclopedia_desc')] is infamous for its seemingly endless abundance and variety of serpents, and we must watch every single step with utmost caution, as seemingly every bush is the home of a dozen vipers."
 etepezea_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL Etepezea#! is the relatively tame and rocky peninsula that sits at the heart of the [Concept('the_continent', 'Shattered Coast')|E]. The coastal hills and valleys are split by the rocky, splintered mountains at Etepezea's core. While the region is relatively pleasant for travelers and amateur hunters a like, many venomous snakes are indigenous to the penninsula. It is not uncommon to encounter one under almost every other rock and bush when traveling through the mountains."

 ## ISLE ##

 imperial_isle_name:90 "Imperial Isle"
 imperial_isle_intro_desc:90 "[Glossary('Imperial Isle','imperial_isle_encyclopedia_desc')] is widely considered one of the most beautiful regions of the [Concept('the_continent', 'Shattered Coast')|E], and has been a popular hunting location for [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] nobility since the earliest days of the empire, as evidenced by the countless villas scattered across its countryside. It is not hard to see why - the year-round pleasant weather, the abundant game and forage, the lack of any dangerous predators, and the overall beauty of the place.\n\nWe set out at dawn, well supplied and in good spirits. Civilization will rarely be far away here if things somehow manage to go awry, and the whole island is oft said to be closer to a vast garden rather than true wilderness."
 imperial_isle_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL The Imperial Isle#! is widely considered one of the most beautiful regions of the [Concept('the_continent', 'Shattered Coast')|E], and has been a popular hunting location for [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] nobility since the earliest days of the empire."
 
 ## ISLES ##

 the_isles_name:90 "The Western Isles"
 the_isles_intro_desc:90 "Any sailor worth their salt on the Sea of Empires will have tales to share of the dangers that lurk beneath the waters of the [Glossary('Western Isles','the_isles_encyclopedia_desc')]. A surprising amount may even turn out to be true - after all, it is no secret that the region leaves ships wrecked or vanished with a depressing frequency, though the local storms are likely to blame for the vast majority of these incidents.\n\nWe weave in between black cliffs and imposing sea stacks, until we finally find a suitably large island to disembark on. The weather is calm, for now, but we must be careful not to linger for too long - the archipelago's ferocious storms could leave us stranded for weeks if we are especially unlucky, and the lack of any forest cover whatsoever means that even on land we will be fully exposed to the vagaries of bad weather."
 the_isles_encyclopedia_desc:90 "As one approaches the northwesternmost reaches of the [Concept('the_continent', 'Shattered Coast')|E], the warm and mostly calm climate of the south is replaced by seas wracked with storms and frequent rainfall. The terrain of the islands themselves also changes - tall, black cliffs rim the coasts of hilly pastureland, with countless sea stacks interspersed between. Due to the area's turbulent waters and often dangerous sea life, it is approached with caution by sailors or avoided entirely."
  
 ## ISLES ##

 tower_isles_name:90 "The Tower Isles"
 tower_isles_intro_desc:90 "The immense ruins lying beneath the [Glossary('Tower Isles','tower_isles_encyclopedia_desc')] are, despite their size, easy to overlook at first. Hidden beneath thickets of sponge, coral and kelp, their artificial nature is first betrayed as one notices the underlying sheen of a golden metal that has somehow not been tarnished by the eons - and after that, the outlines of colossal spires, archways, statues and windows become ever more clear to the keen observer.\n\nWe disembark on an isle next to one particularly large cluster of submerged buildings — no doubt once a city of such a scale that it would dwarf almost any standing today — and make a final stock of our equipment."
 tower_isles_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Tower Isles#! are a large, ring shaped archipelago centered on the [sea_tower|E], with a warm climate in the southeast that gradually cools off as one travels northwestward. Sunken ruins of an unknown origin dominate the relatively shallow waters of the local sea, though their impressive forms are largely obscured by dense thickets of coral and sponge that are home to a large variety of [Concept('magic','Magical')|E] aquatic creatures."
 
 ## ISLES ##

 central_isles_name:90 "The Central Isles"
 central_isles_intro_desc:90 "With each island we pass it feels like we are discovering somewhere new. On one side of our boat, a colossal cliffside of blistering white rock stands tall above us. On the other, a thin beach snakes around the islands edge, buffered by a dense thicket of shrubbery and violet trees.\n\nWe disembark on a relatively tame coastline of rock and prickly pears — the gentle sea breeze washing over us as we unload. A vast flock of brightly colored birds rise from somewhere on the island and arc across the sky above us. While we may still have some distance to go, I can't help but feel excited for what we may find in these waters."
 central_isles_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Central Isles#! is an archipelago found at the heart of the Shattered Coast. While the climate is generally mild and dry, scholars have long considered it impossible to generalize the natural environment of the islands due to their wide range in both geography and ecology. While some may be extremely fertile breadbaskets, others may be nothing more than barren rocks, and there are just as many beaches as sheer cliffs of marble. The islands tend to be more volatile and rocky the closer one is to Malcois.\n\nSome Aversarian scholars have theorized that the islands may have once been a mountain range that sunk into the sea, though there has been inconclusive evidence to support this."
 
 ## GUILLATE ##

 guillate_rocks_name:90 "Rocks of Guillate"
 guillate_rocks_intro_desc:90 "We noticed the moment we crossed from the [Glossary('Tower Isles','tower_isles_encyclopedia_desc')] into the [Glossary('Rocks of Guillate','guillate_rocks_encyclopedia_desc')] as the water changed from pristine to a dark, swirling mix of greens and blues. The further we travel, more crystalline structures emerge from the water. Some seem to shine as the sunlight hits them, lightly coloring the sea along their reef.\n\nAfter nearly smashing our boat against crystals hiding just beneath the waters surface, we make landfall on a beach laying beneath two cliff sides that look cracked in half. A handful of trees cling to the rock, jutting out into the air above us like limbs. While we may have had an early brush with danger, there will likely be many more on the journey ahead."
 guillate_rocks_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The jagged #BOL Rocks of Guillate#! snake from the Aloysian Sea to the Waking Coast. These isles are characterized commonly for their crystal reefs that border much of the region. These reefs can often be found jutting out above the water's surface, and in some areas are larger than the nearest island. While the climate is generally calm and cool throughout the cold season, harsh storms become much more common in the warm as hurricanes batter the [Glossary('Western Isles','the_isles_encyclopedia_desc')]. Many unique fauna and flora can only be found in the Rocks, often having formed unique relationships with the crystal formations along the atolls and reefs."


 ## ARCHIPELAGO ##

 lonely_light_name:90 "Lonely Light Archipelago"
 lonely_light_intro_desc:90 "$generic_intro_desc$"
 lonely_light_encyclopedia_desc:90 "Lonely Light is a rocky, volcanic archipelago far to the north west of the [Concept('aversaria','Shattered Coast')|E]. While much of their north are tundra, the islands are well known for dense herbage and ferns. What few trees survive are thought to have been brought by settlers from old Oejeynica. There is little snow, but rain and fog are common year round.\n\nThe most common fauna are often seabirds in migration, with numerous colonies on the north shores. The surrounding waters are also famous for great whales and orcas that dominate the sea, as well as massive sea lions, making travel hazardous for the inexperienced. Some fauna, such as reindeer, were brought from the mainland, but the native blue foxes, llamas, and otters are abundant enough to keep a strong fur trade flowing to [chevalie|E] and beyond."
 
 chevalie_name:90 "Chevalie"
 chevalie_intro_desc:90 "The wilds of [Glossary('Chevalie','chevalie_encyclopedia_desc')] have a magical charm to them, despite the region's history. Rolling pastures fade away into the dense forests and rocky mountain ranges that dominate the land's interior. Mountains stand guard to Chevalie's north, where some say the closer you get to the [the_lichdoms|E], the more the rain sours. The forests reach high into the sky, their evergreen leaves and needles covering lichen that creeps across the forest floor. The dense, uniform tree trunks make it near impossible to find your way through without the mountains peaking above their canopies. Travel can be difficult, even treacherous, for those unprepared.\n\nThe closer to the coasts you journey, the forests will brighten as the topsoil becomes covered in dense shrubbery and layers of plant life, the trees growing deep and wide. The farther into the hills and mountains you climb, the more dangerous the trek will be, as the most ferocious of Chevalie's creatures call them home. Steep fjords, carved by the eons, stand tall above the western coasts, while murky bogs dot the forests towards the east, shrouded in mist.\n\nThese forests are a wonder to any huntsmen worth his salt, but do not drop your guard- despite its beauty, these woods are not for the weak."
 chevalie_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL Chevalie#! is most commonly associated with the Anti-Magic Field that blankets the region and shields it from the harrowed [the_lichdoms|E] further north. The lowland fields are considered relatively safe for travelers, but the dense forests and mountain ranges are far more treacherous, and rich with fauna, including [griffons|E].

 ## MOOR ##

 konijkmener_name:90 "Granmaer Moor"
 konijkmener_intro_desc:90 "Our journey into the [Glossary('Granmaer Moor','konijkmener_encyclopedia_desc')] has been no easy feat, but now the wilderness of the Konijk Marshes lie before us. From the dike we are perched on, I can see the thick maze of forests throughout the landscape, intermixed with misty bogs untouched by the locals' efforts. Deep green leaves cascade into the browns and blues of the reed-filled waterways that mark our path. The scent of pine from the coast fades as oak and beech become more prevalent, and the trill of lynxes mix in with more disturbing moans from the deep marsh.\n\nAs the groups moves deeper into the growth, the rivers grow wilder and erratic as they flood into the bogs. The air hangs heavy, and our mood grows somber."
 konijkmener_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Granmaer Moor#! sits to the south of [Glossary('Chevalie','chevalie_encyclopedia_desc')], where rivers and bogs cut it off from the tamer lands of the north. The harsh wetlands are challenge enough for any who venture into the depths of the Peninsula, but travellers also need beware the denizens of its thick beech forests and fetid marshlands. Large elk roam between the maze of trees, and porpoises await any foolish enough to lose their footing on the slippery dunes of the coasts. Worst of all, there are rumours of leviathans hidden beneath the bogs, able to trap even the most skilled travellers in their misty lairs."

Ashfall and blood have blanketed the region, the former providing the mountain's their namesake. What creatures do call these lands home are just as sturdy as the mountains themselves, and often roam the untamed groves and valleys that cut between the rock.

 ## REDLANDS ##

 redlands_intro_desc:90 "Travelers regularly call the wastes of the [Glossary('Redlands','redlands_encyclopedia_desc')] one of the most inhospitable places on Aeras, possibly at a level with the [the_lichdoms|E] and [foglands|E]. A miserable realm of blasted red sands and rocks and high levels of latent magics; scholars around the world have attempted to figure out what exactly formed the region's unique geography for centuries. They have all failed, primarily because the Redland's dangers have consumed thousands of would-be explorers and most neighboring cultures have learned to reject and avoid it. Even the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E] for all of their hatred of foreigners declared the interior of the Redlands the home of the Redlanders and only built settlements along the almost habitable coast.\n\nIn the Redlands, the deeper one goes, the threats exponentially increase, especially as one enters the mysterious ravines that dominate the Redland's interior. All who spend more than a small amount of time in the region hear strange and disturbing voices, and the ritual chanting of the thousand cults of the Redland interior seem to drift through thousands of small holes that dot almost every surface. Even worse, some of the most hostile and eldritch creatures known to humanity call the interior their home, from horrifying masses of tentacles known as Kesrravarga to the vein-rooting fungus of Ugk'ilrrrmags. Magi especially seem to be affected by the hellish biome, the majority going insane the second they leave the struggling coastal cities.\n\nThe only thing here to give one peace of mind is that the chances of dying of starvation or thirst in the barren interior is minimal, as the chances of cult sacrifice, fungus explosion, dreamdeath, madness, [Concept('overwhelmation', 'magic sickness')|E], chest-devouring body-controlling parasite infestation, and far more kill over half of non-natives who venture well before hunger ever becomes a concern."
 redlands_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Redlands#! are considered one of the most dangerous regions on [aeras|E].

 ## MALCOIS ##

 malcois_name:90 "Malcois"
 malcois_intro_desc:90 "[Glossary('Malcois','malcois_encyclopedia_desc')] possesses a temperate environment generally considered pleasant if not quite drab and dreary. Great cliffs of marble and granite dominate whatever parts of Malcois aren't covered by rolling hills and deep-cut ravines, and most of the area immediately away from the coast is considered quite rugged and inhospitable due to the lack of arable land and the jagged terrain. Despite this, it is devoid of many more dangerous oddities and creatures encountered elsewhere on Aeras.\n\nIn spite of the relative safety, however, there do remain dangers. The thousand years of brutal slavery against the Iyrossi have produced numerous angry spirits and loose mutants, and the horrific fighting of the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E] and the Kartharaddi Wars left many strange beasts and ghasts behind as testament that remain to this day. Finally, some of its more hostile native species still survive in the more isolated corners of the otherwise prosperous Mytidon Valley, though the natives have largely kept them highly rare or likely extinct."
 malcois_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL Malcois#! is most well known for the rugged cliffs and mountains that dominate and shield the region on all sides. The interior is cut by deep ravines and rolling hills that give the otherwise temperate land an incredibly rugged feel. Despite what the wilderness may portray, there are very few natural dangers left in the wild. Many believe this to have been thanks to the ancient Iyrossi's obsessive honor culture having led to the destruction of many of the region's more dangerous species."

The rich soil has long been a boon to the locals, though the scars of bloody conflicts have taken long to heal in these lands, leaving much farmland overgrown. The mild climates lends itself to dry, mild summers and wet winters, as well as long growing seasons.

 aironoian_southeast_encyclopedia_desc:90 "Deep canyons, forested plateaus, and rocky mesas dominate the #BOL Aironoian Southeast#!, crisscrossing the region all the way toward the Redlands further south. In the lowlands, you will primarily find dry shrubbery and scattered plains that give way to the pinyon-juniper woodlands at higher elevations. The region is parched, with few springs and little rainfall year round. The diverse fauna of the southeast ranges from small rodents and reptiles to the far larger bears and antelopes of the woodland. Deep under the canyons, there are several massive aquifers that supply much of the region's water supply.

It is incredibly hospitable despite its surroundings, with pleasant ocean breezes from the south cooling the otherwise humid and hot sands of southern Aironoi, and with a great variety of wildlife and greenery that remains sparse enough as to not intrude upon human habitation. Were this not tempting enough for would-be settlers, the area is also considered one of the richest in gold in the world, and nearly all writings by explorers visiting the region have endlessly obsessed over the unique sheen and hue of the regions rivers, which take on a green and gold hint thanks to a seemingly endless supply of gold flakes.\n\nDespite this, the area remains almost completely free of permanent settlement by outsiders, and its resources remain largely untapped. While a variety of factors have led to the Fool's Coast' lack of populace, the largest one remains its eponymous '[fools_curse|E]', an exceptionally deadly disease seemingly carried upon gold and gems removed from the region that only the native population carries any immunity for. With most water and the largest point of interest to the region action as a literal poison, the Fool's Coast has remained a beautiful, vibrant, and empty habitat."

This barricade separates Northern Sarradon, with its rich towns, rivers, warlords, and fat merchants from the interior, sheltering the continent's more refined people from the brutality of the great interior desert. In dividing these two divergent territories, the mountains of Sarradon have taken up some character from each. Here the valleys flourish with greenery, fed by cool, sweet springs and melting snow. But also here are harsh paths scaling rocky cliffsides, and highland plateaus which have never known the touch of rain. Even where the Sarradonian mountains are at their most hospitable, a traveler should beware lurking dangers- lions, manticores, and cave bears are common threats, not to mention the tales told by local tribes of stranger beasts, enigmatic and deadly."

In its distant past the region was far more heavily forested, but with the diversion of the Kemsar River the once misty forests rapidly dried and thinned.\n\nForest fires killed much of the rest, and what survives clusters in strips that arc along the Lahkorini and Tashkorf rivers, extending north and south into scattered groves along the mountains. Date-plums and lilac persimmons are common fruits throughout these small remnant forests, though travelers would be ill advised if they took freely from the trees and bushes, as many types of poisonous flora still thrive throughout the woods and heaths.

As we proceed into Damota, the towering trees block out the sun, only thin shafts of light reaching the forest floor through the thick canopy.\n\nEven in the middle of the day, when the sun is directly overhead, it is at times necessary to use torches or magical lights to see the ground before us, and it is understandably easy to lose oneself in this vibrant and lush darkness. Insects swarm around us, buzzing through the wet air, which seems to weigh down upon us.

 crater_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The great crater of #BOL Kratemezin#! is a shallow tropical sea ringed by a thin strip of fertile coast in northeast [sarradon|E]. Possessing rich sea life, generally pleasant (if humid) weather and a heavily cultivated landscape — mostly dominated by agricultural wetlands and light rainforest — the area is generally considered one of the most idyllic in the continent's tropical belt.\n\nPerhaps the most famed local inhabitants are the great saratans that wander the bay's shallow waters, creatures that have only been observed in a scant few other regions in the entire known world."

 ## MANGROVES ##

 rojihlat_intro_desc:90 "$generic_intro_desc$"
 rojihlat_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Rohijlat Mangroves#! stretch from the southern edge of [Glossary('Kratemezin','crater_encyclopedia_desc')] to the Bay of Stone. Reefs and sand barges protect much of the coastline, providing ample safety for the bountiful forests, mud flats and scattered mangrove isolas. While the flora is consistently beautiful — transitioning from massive orange mangroves to white and black the further inland one goes, the region boasts little of floral biodiversity. Traversing the forests has often been considered simple and almost relaxing due to the ease and openness of the waterways, though the interior can be much more treacherous due to massive peat deposits."
 
 ## AEKERSHAAN ##

 aekershaan_name:90 "Aekershaan"
 aekershaan_intro_desc:90 "$generic_intro_desc$"
 aekershaan_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL Aekershaan#! is the name for the crater west of the Gulf of Rinah and [Glossary('Kratemezin','crater_encyclopedia_desc')]. The region is well known for the drastic contrasts in ecology as the elevation changes. Its upper reaches consist of scattered scrubland beneath the sand blasted mountains that surround the crater. As one travels downward, the scrub gives way to arid grasslands and scattered, solitary trees. The lowest elevations are where the majority of the region's farmland is, as well mixed tropical cloud forests, due to the rich soil quality.\n\nWhile the fauna of the region can vary wildly due to the contrasting climates, Mezzarb goats are known to live throughout Aekershaan, and are commonly used as mounts and pack animals in all three layers of the crater."

 ## AMSAR ##

 amsar_name:90 "Amsar"
 amsar_intro_desc:90 "$generic_intro_desc$"
 amsar_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL Amsar#! is a land of immense ecological diversity, and over the long ages has seen drastic changes to both its human and animal inhabitants. Deep in antiquity it was known as an arid land. In those days, only some lucky regions in lower Amsar were graced with enough water to support meager vegetation and itinerant farming. Today, that same region is a lush paradise crisscrossed by farms, orchards, and well-groomed woodlands kept as hunting preserves by the nobility. Only the mountains of Amsar have remained almost unchanged from this nearly forgotten age. Foreboding, immense, and riddled with a labyrinth of enigmatic stone highways strung across its peaks and valleys, they have a way of swallowing up even the most well-prepared travelers.\n\nIn Amsar game can be found aplenty, thanks in large part to the efforts of bored Qanamsars from ages past, who decreed the importation of the wild game their once-desert land was missing. Most of these animals are benign, but populations of wolves, lions, and other dangerous predators have taken root in the hinterlands thanks to the fickle adventurism of the Hiklahn's often eccentric high nobility.\n\nThese same nobles can also be thanked for driving the Amsar valley's oldest and strangest inhabitants uphill into the mountains, thus turning the valley into the place of tranquility and safety it is today. Nevertheless, among the great and ancient peaks those entities from the dawn of time still lurk, gazing enviously upon the green and bounteous valley below."

 ## KEMSAR ##

 kemsar_name:90 "Kemsar"
 kemsar_intro_desc:90 "Located in the west of [sarradon|E], [Glossary('Kemsar','kemsar_encyclopedia_desc')] is a dry wasteland dominated by hot days and cold nights. Vegetation is almost nonexistent and only the strongest and most ruthless animals survive - animals such as the extremely venomous and elusive Dire Scorpions or Dire Scarabs which are notorious for attacking unsuspecting travelers. They attack in swarms, and leave only sun-bleached bones.\n\nMy hunting party and I are dressed in cloaks and the traditional headgear often worn by nomads in the region to protect us from the scorching sun. Our local guide came at a bargain, the strange man only asking for water as payment. With him leading the way we are now traveling across the scorching dunes, and I wonder what awaits us in this wasteland so far away from everything"
 kemsar_encyclopedia_desc:90 "Located west of [sarradon|E], #BOL Kemsar#! is a land of vast dunes and arid badlands with  few scattered oases. It was once the cradle of the Kemsari empire of which only ruins remain, and despite the passage of time, they still stand as monuments throughout the desert. Scattered across the scorching sands, the descendants of the ancient Kemsari now live a nomadic life fighting for survival alongside the dangerous fauna that calls these dunes home."
 
 ## KASIRYAT ##

 kasiryat_name:90 "The Kasiryat"
 kasiryat_intro_desc:90 "The cool breeze coming off of the [Glossary('Kasiryat','kasiryat_encyclopedia_desc')] has kept our spirits high on our journey into the tall grass. Each blade nearly comes up to my stomach, making it hard to tell what exactly I am stepping in, but the idyllic river coasts are known to be rather tame compared to much of the surrounding regions.\n\nAs we finally find a high point over the swaying fields around us, I can take in the lush wilderness. Scattered remnants of forests, solitary trees in seas of green blades gently blown against by strong winds. I wonder what creatures we'll find here."
 kasiryat_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL The Kasiryat#! is the larger river that separates the lands of Aironoi from [kashirya|E] in the east. Large swathes of fertile plain and swamp buffer the river against the steppe further west, and the [Glossary('Kharadan Mountains','north_kharadan_encyclopedia_desc')] to the east. The Kasiryat's fields are a mosaic of tall, riverside grasslands and near evergreen forests that thin out the further you travel from the fresh waters. Many animals from across both Aironoi and Kashirya can be found along the river, making it a popular destination for travelers and hunters alike."

 ## MOUNTAINS ##

 north_kharadan_name:90 "Northern Kharadan Mountains"
 north_kharadan_intro_desc:90 "Hunting in the [Glossary('Northern Kharadan Mountains','north_kharadan_encyclopedia_desc')] is unusual, to say the least. It is generally accepted that even the most ferocious of elementals that dwell atop its snowy peaks pale in terms of danger in comparison to the environment itself. Even if the weather stays clear throughout, the terrain means that in some places we're likely going to have to make fully vertical climbs, and if we happen to get caught in one of the monstrous blizzards that regularly consume the area we are likely as good as dead.\n\nWe have taken great pains to ensure that we are as prepared for this journey as one can be - and still, we feel woefully unready for the undertaking at hand. As the last of the forests around us are replaced by bleak stone and we encounter the first patches of snow, we are finally allowed a completely clear of the mountain range in front — nay, #BOL above#! us — we are left with one last chance to reconsider whether this endeavor is worth the risk."
 north_kharadan_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL North Kharadan Mountains#! are home to some of the tallest peaks on [aeras|E], with even most of the "lesser" ones making otherwise impressive mountains in the rest of the world seem like paltry hillocks in comparison. Predictably, the environment is inimical to most life - terrain so treacherous so as to require either magic or specialized equipment to traverse, permanent snow cover and wildly unpredictable weather mean that the only inhabitants are a scant number of highly specialized mundane animals and, more significantly, elementals."

 ## HYRATAN ##

 hyratan_name:90 "Hyratan"
 hyratan_intro_desc:90 "Accessing [Glossary('Hyratan','crater_encyclopedia_desc')] and its wilds is no easy task — most routes into the region are so treacherous so as to not even be worth trying to take, with only a select few gorges and valleys allowing for relatively safe passage. Once entered, though travel becomes somewhat easier, visibility and navigation conversely become serious problems, with all but the tallest of the neighboring peaks completely obscured by the dense pine canopy overhead.\n\nA crisp mountain air greets us as we ascend into the area, and we follow a small river upstream until the surrounding meadows thin to nothingness and are entirely replaced by dense coniferous forests. It is time we plunge into Hyratan's darkness."
 hyratan_encyclopedia_desc:90 "Located among some of the tallest mountains in the world, the great valleys of #BOL Hyratan#! are dominated by dense pine forests only rarely broken up by montane meadows - most often either in places with human habitation or as one approaches the rocky heights upland. Owing to its relatively sparse population, exceptionally thick woodland and generally mystical reputation, the region has become imprinted in Kashiryan folk tales as a place of wondrous and terrible monsters. Sometimes, these creatures even turn out to be more than mere stories."

 ## PLAIN ##

 darmirat_plain_name:90 "Darmirat Plain"
 darmirat_plain_intro_desc:90 "$generic_intro_desc$"
 darmirat_plain_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Darmirat Plain#! is a large, alluvial plain that straddles the interior of northern [kashirya|E] against the [Glossary('Magiyor Plateau','magiyor_encyclopedia_desc')] further south. Countless streams and creeks coarse through the plains, bringing soil sediments down from the mountains. Towering rock formations whose sheer immensity can be seen from anywhere in the surrounding lands stand above the few monsoon forests of the region, who maintain near evergreen color year round. The largest buffalo on [aeras|E], the Gaur, can be found in great abundance throughout the region."

 ## FLATS ##

 kashti_flats_name:90 "Kashti Flats"
 kashti_flats_intro_desc:90 "$generic_intro_desc$"
 kashti_flats_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Kashti Flats#! were once a major delta that has long since dried as sea levels changed over the preceding millenia, leaving behind a vast network of salt marshes that straddle northern Kashirya's coastlines. Strips of near arid grassland separate the salt marshes from the interior, but the marshes themselves are known to rival even [sarradon|E] in their heat. The salt clay and mudflats fill with standing water during the monsoon season, and in incredibly wet years will extend further south. Flamingos are common through out the flats, and are known to use the few scattered islets that stand above the sea level as breeding grounds during the high floods."

 ## PLATEAU ##

 magiyor_name:90 "Magiyor Plateau"
 magiyor_intro_desc:90 "The famed land of the Winter-Fire Bloom, the [Glossary('Magiyor Plateau','magiyor_encyclopedia_desc')] is considered to be one of the prime hunting grounds of [kashirya|E]. Mostly pleasant (if sometimes brisk) year-round weather, easy navigation, and a lack of natural hazards means that any visiting hunter will be able to focus purely on actual hunting, without having to dedicate significant amounts of focus and energy to mere survival.\n\nIt is difficult not to be overwhelmed by a sense of vastness as one ascends the plateau. Towards the north lie some of the tallest, most foreboding mountain peaks in the world, while all around is a seemingly endless meadow, only occasionally broken up by a brilliant blue river or lonely pine grove. Even if our hunt isn't successful, coming here was arguably worth it for the view alone."
 magiyor_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The montane meadows of the #BOL Magiyor Plateau#! stand in the shadow of the colossal [Glossary('Kharadan Mountains','north_kharadan_encyclopedia_desc')], though they themselves are only gently hilly. The area is famed for its crisp-clear glacial rivers and the brilliant winter bloom of the Magiyati Fire Daisy - a flower with magical properties that colors the grasslands a fiery amber and emits enough heat to allow life to thrive as if completely unaffected by what would otherwise be a harsh mountain winter."

 ## FOOTHILLS ##

 kafasali_name:90 "Kafasali Foothills"
 kafasali_intro_desc:90 "Standing in the [Glossary('Kafasali Foothills','kafasali_encyclopedia_desc')] you can see the escarpment of the [Glossary('Magiyor Plateau','magiyor_encyclopedia_desc')] far in the distance, almost in line with the gargantuan mountains that stand above it to the east. We've long since set out into the wilds of Kafasali, though the journey is slow. The thorn filled shrubbery and trees have proved more than effective at slowing us down, and have left a multitude of cuts and scratches across all of us, but the worst is the terrain. For every flat field of tall grass and thorns, there's another of rocky footholds that give way under the slightest pressure. What large fauna we've come across so far has been more than able to escape us with ease due to our clumsiness, but if we hope to come away from this venture successfully, we'll need to be cautious with our step."
 kafasali_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL Kafasali#! is the name given to the dry fields, forests, and rocky hills separated from northern [kashirya|E] by the [Glossary('Magiyor Plateau','magiyor_encyclopedia_desc')]. Due to the plateau, the [Glossary('Kharadan Mountains','north_kharadan_encyclopedia_desc')] to the east, and the region's tall hills along the coast, Kafasali is almost entirely protected from the Monsoon season, making this one of the driest regions in Kashirya. Subtropical deciduous forests and thorn scrub forests dominate much of the wilderness. The rolling fields of semiarid brush break against crags and rock features that stand tall over the surrounding forestry. Some of these massive hills and pointed rocks support forts and keeps that stand guard over the region, though many have fallen into ruin over the centuries. Despite the semiarid climate, Kafasali supports a vast array of fauna, primarily in its many species of Birds that are said to outnumber all that live in the [Concept('the_continent', 'Shattered Coast')|E]."

 ## FORESTS ##

 vichacil_name:90 "Vichacil Forests"
 vichacil_intro_desc:90 "Our journey into the [Glossary('Vichacil Forests','vichacil_encyclopedia_desc')] has been arduous, but well worth the effort. The dew covered grass was slick beneath our boots as we climbed to our vantage point a top a steep hill, and I nearly lost my footing more than once, but what a sight to behold. While the low wetlands of the coast were bright with the colors and movement of city life, the deep wilderness that stands tall through the valleys and groves before us shimmer like a field of milky jade. Dense, misty forests stretch across the horizon, broken by tall fields of watery underbrush and the occasional plantation tucked betwixt the ancient canopy.\n\nWe take the plunge deeper, following a snake like stream that courses through the forest. Song birds sing a tune above our heads as we travel, setting an otherwise joyous mood in our hearts."
 vichacil_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Vichacil Forests#! roll across the southern edge of [kashirya|E] eastward, toward the soft cool peaks of the Southern Kharadan Mountains. The Hills are heavily forested, supporting a vast ecosystem of tropical montane cloud forests that experience a near constant, low cloud coverage that supplies much of the forests moisture. The evergreen wilderness faces two monsoon seasons annually, one in mid winter from the west, and other in late spring from the southeast. The lowlands closer to the coasts have experienced several massive floods, some submerging entire areas ever since, and these floods have had large effects on the local inhabitants and the ways they build their infrastructure. The hills are also incredibly diverse, with many fauna being unknown elsewhere on Aeras. Bovines and elephantids can be found in abundance, though far stranger things are said to lurk in the misty corners and depths of the forests."

 ## KATUPPILAN ##

 katuppilan_name:90 "Katuppilan"
 katuppilan_intro_desc:90 "The wild backwaters of [Glossary('Katuppilan','katuppilan_encyclopedia_desc')] are said to be one of the most mysterious and dangerous places to hunt in all of [kashirya|E]. The dense labyrinth of mangroves and swamp make traversal difficult, but the rich and mysterious creatures that are said to lurk in the brackish depths draw hunters and adventurers from all over. That is not to say they survive the journey, but we hope to fare far better fates than them.\n\nOr at least, we did. Katuppilan has proven to be more dangerous than anticipated. Our small river boat has already suffered enough damage from the dense roots beneath the water's surface to force us onto the marshy soil earlier than we would have liked. Now on land, we've trudged deep into the mangrove's web, leaving markings behind where we can to not lose our way in this watery maze. Every step seems to sink me deeper into the mud, but we must carry on. Hopefully we can still find our way back."
 katuppilan_encyclopedia_desc:90 "The #BOL Katuppilan#! is the name given to the dense mangrove forests and mud flats along the Kashiryan coasts. This massive forest fills much of the waterways and river systems of the south, making travel difficult into the interior. The mudflats, marshes, and brackish waterways of the broadleaf swamp forests have been more settled than the saltwater forests further off of the coasts, which remain mostly uninhabited. The winter monsoon season hits Katuppilan hard annually, and precipitation levels remain high in the region year round. During high tide, much of the mangroves are completely submerged. Despite how rich these mangroves are in flora and fauna, local inhabitants tend to avoid venturing too deep out of fear and superstition for the creatures that live there. Tigers, crabs, and giant frogs are just some of the animals to inhabit these forests, but with much of the interior unmapped and uninhabited, the mangroves hold many secrets."

 rovarska_intro_desc:90 "We've set out on boat into the winding waterways of [Glossary('Rovarska','rovarska_encyclopedia_desc')]. On all sides of us, verdant forests stand tall over the islands, the cacophany of insects and animals blaring from between the dense tree trunks and vines. Flocks of birds spring forth across the sky, dancing in such rhythym across the heavens as if they were sending messages to their nests below.\n\nBy the time we reach shore of an uninhabited island deep within the archipelago, much of my clothes are slick with sweat and moisture from their air. The forest line stands just beyond us, and I see several monkeys galavant across the canopy as we prepare our equipment for the journey into the rainforest."
 rovarska_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL Rovarska#!, or as it is more commonly known, the #BOL "Pirate Coast,"#! is an archipelago that straddles the edge of the Sea of Empires, and the Eastern Ocean. Dense, lowland rainforests cover much of the islands' geography, broken only by scattered montane meadows, fresh water basins, and craggy volcanoes. The topography is increasingly jagged further into the archipelago, the results of volcanic activity over millenia, and many larger ships often have difficulty navigating the tight and narrow waterways separating the interior. Reptiles and avians of all shapes and sizes are common throughout the islands, though travelers are often warned to be wary of travelling too deep into the forests, nor eating anything not sold by a merchant. The poisonous fruits and herbs of the islands, not to mention the fauna, are well known for their potency."
 
 ## COAST ##

 nightcoast_intro_desc:90 "$generic_intro_desc$"
 nightcoast_encyclopedia_desc:90 "#BOL The Night Coast#! is a region that spans much of southeastern [kashirya|E], so named for its exceptional night-time properties. A relatively normal tropical jungle by day, after sunfall the region takes on such vibrant colors that it begins to seem almost alien.\n\nMost obviously, the sky becomes so spectacular that even the most pristine of skies elsewhere in the world seem like a cheap imitation in comparison at best - the orange backdrop of the Crucible grows so intense that it begins to resemble a flame that outshines [aervalr|E], the Twin Rivers seem to actually flow, the stars of the Forest take on unnatural colors and are noted to resemble the bloom of spring flowers, and the Void's borders become so crisp and clear that many report a sense of vertigo upon seeing the great "hole in the night sky" so clearly for the first time. Even constellations low on the horizon like the north polar Crown are completely unaffected by their position, being as clear and visible as if they were directly overhead.\n\nThe effect, however, is hardly exclusive to the sky. Massive populations of variously-colored glow-coral and bioluminescent marine creatures light up the ocean to a level that almost matches the celestial firmament. The water clarity means that one can see every single shoal of glowing fish down to the equally brightly-lit bottom in a bedazzling array of colors, though with the noted characteristic that creatures of a similar color often cluster together. Even on land, flora with glowing flowers illuminates the jungle to such an extent that visibility often becomes better than during the day."

Adventurers have remarked that in some parts, the land is so silent you can nearly hear your own heart. The air is known to burn as one breathes due to a overwhelming aroma of sulfur. Whole stretches of land have been ripped from the ground, leaving nothing but gaping holes straight to the heart of Aeras. What little weather patterns remain are nothing more than dust storms and magically charged clouds of ash that rise from the volcanic rifts. Vast necropolises dot this husk of a region, surrounded by mountains of bone. Travelers of all kinds should know to avoid these lands at all costs, lest they wish to lose their lives, or worse."

Little is known of the local fauna outside scant traces of bears and wolves, though much debate exists on what creatures may be found deeper into the wood. Most of the region remains unexplored, and over the centuries it has gained a reputation for being haunted, or cursed. Tales of Aversarian expeditions disappearing, or forgotten ruins of lost Kartharaddi colonies, are all too common, and explorers seeking to uncover the mysteries of the Whisperveil should proceed with extreme caution, lest they experience a similar fate."

 red_waste_intro_desc:90 "Crossing from the golden sunflowers and rocky hills of [Glossary('Western Opakhasia','western_opakhasia_encyclopedia_desc')] into the burnt landscape of the [Glossary('Red Waste','red_waste_encyclopedia_desc')] did not damper our moods, at first, but it did not take long for our eyes to dry, and our throats, burn. The air chokes, tasting of hot smoke and burnt flesh. With every step we take further into this harsh hellscape, part of me questions our choice to come here.\n\nWe reach the top of a cracked and barren hill that can see into a dried lakebed below. I almost did not notice the crumbling ruins that might've once been a town beside the lake; all that remains are bricks and rubble.
