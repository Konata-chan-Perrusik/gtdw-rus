It was ignited by the return of [Glossary('Carttuen Silver-Hair', 'CARTTUEN_SILVER_HAIR_GLOSS')], who sought to enact the ritual known as the I-Amanthil, which would've merged the realms of the mundane and those of [aspect_dream], finally returning the land of the fey to what she perceived to be its rightful masters.\n\nCarttuen would ultimately be defeated by a vast coalition of local Etrandexi, Aversarians, Clanlanders and even dissenting fey, and the conclusion of the war would result in the establishment of the Truce of the Hearth and Wood, which finally delineated the boundaries of the old powers and the realms of man, putting an end to fifty years of bloodshed and ending large-scale conflict between the two sides for good."
