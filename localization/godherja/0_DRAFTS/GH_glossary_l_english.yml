 # Historical Rulers & Dynasties: Mikros Kalathipsomi

 ALORIC_THE_HAUGHTY_GLOSS: "#BOL Aloric the Haughty#! was the last Etrandexi ruler to style himself king of Faegift, reigning on the eve of the Aversarian conquest in the 4th century. A grasping man, he would be chiefly remembered for his ambitions of becoming High King of the Reach, an endeavor that he would be foiled in by Marcomer.

 RED_RICOMER_GLOSS: "#BOL Red Ricomer#! is a figure of uncertain nature — possibly more of a title than a singular person — that reportedly protects the groves of the [GetBuilding('01_nira_yew').GetName]. According to legend, he was a Shewigad brigand who felled one of its trees — an act of grave sacrilege. Overcome with guilt, he swore an oath to defend the site he desecrated, and ripped out his own tongue thereafter. For centuries he would mete out punishment for any who dared not respect the customs of the Nira Yew, no matter how high or low their station. Ricomer's proficiency with the bow is second to none, and few could hope to evade his wrath for long.\n\nDuring the [Glossary('War of the Black Yew', 'WAR_OF_THE_BLACK_YEW_GLOSS')], he would serve as one of [Glossary('Carttuen Silver-Hair', 'dailennir_kathanouxiac_18_desc')]'s lieutenants, most infamously leading a campaign that would culminate in the destruction of the left bank of the city of Audbrue. Despite the ultimate defeat of the fey in the war, Red Ricomer himself would escape death, and he is said to intermittently reappear in the lands he swore to protect to this very day."

It was ignited by the return of [Glossary('Carttuen Silver-Hair', 'dailennir_kathanouxiac_18_desc')], who sought to enact the ritual known as the I-Amanthil, which would've merged the realms of the mundane and those of [aspect_dream], and also fulfilling a by then six-century long propehecy that she would rule Kathanouxa's long-dead empire.\n\nCarttuen would ultimately be defeated by a vast coalition of local Etrandexi, Aversarians, Clanlanders and even dissenting fey, and the conclusion of the war would result in the establishment of the Truce of the Hearth and Wood, which finally delineated the boundaries of the old powers and the realms of man, putting an end to fifty years of bloodshed and ending large-scale conflict between the two sides for good."

Aautokratia Theyssia had much of the unfathomably ancient ruins the complex was built on rebuilt how architects and of the era imagined they had appeared during the [first_empire|E], and it would be considered the magical capital of Etepezea until its destruction in the aftermath of [the_vilnian_assault|E|l]."
