 #game_concept_amsar: "Amsar" Name is already defined elsewhere probably for the old aliases
 game_concept_amsar_desc: "Amsar refers to both the region itself and as an alternate name for the Amsari Hiklahn. It borders untamed lands to the west, the arid [kemsar_biozone|E] to the south, and the Sheharddi city-states to the southeast. Amsar is a land of striking contrasts, ranging from barren hills to lush plains nourished by rivers descending from distant mountains. Its geographical isolation has profoundly influenced its history and culture, fostering an inward-looking realm with limited engagement economically and politically from the rest of [sarradon|E].\n\nTo outsiders, Amsar often appears as a single, unified, and stable realm, its vast coastline dotted with imposing fortresses and prosperous cities. However, beneath this façade lies a complex history marked by internal crises, partly fueled by frequent siblicide among the most powerful dynasties, cutthroat politics, and periods of profound uncertainty, the most recent to date being the [gh_century_of_crisis|E].\n\nThe region's recent history is inseparable from the people who share its name, the Amsari, as well as [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E|l]. As such, [Concept('mixed_magi','Dream Magi')|E] hold a revered position in Amsari society and is often theorized by scholars to represent the central form of magic from which all others originate. Most [magi|E] are [gh_frazan|E] or have at least undergone training under the Frazani."
 
 game_concept_gh_the_amsari_prophet: "The Prophet"
 game_concept_gh_the_amsari_prophet_desc: "The Prophet is the most significant figure in recent Zaoranian history, whose teachings continue to influence [amsar|E]. Believed to have been born under a divine sign, almost nothing is known about their early life. In 201 IS, the Prophet emerged from a three-day prophetic trance and revealed the truths of the Breaking of Chains and the [Concept('frodbrokna','Event of the Dead Moon')|E] to the Thousand Holy Witnesses, foretelling events in great detail, events not only in [sarradon|E] but across [aeras|E]. Following this revelation, the Prophet traveled across [amsar|E], preaching the [gh_zenda|E] and laying the foundations for a shared Amsari identity, amongst which was the [gh_rham|E|l]."

 game_concept_gh_zenda: "Zenda"
 game_concept_gh_zenda_desc: "The [Glossary('Zenda', 'GH_ZENDA_GLOSS')] is the sacred body of knowledge encompassing the revelations of [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E|l], recorded and preserved by Amsari scholars. It contains the foretellings of future events, including the Battle of the Broken Chain, and the Dead Moon, serving as a guide to understanding Zaoran's will.\n\nThough the Prophet's teachings were delivered as a continuous narrative throughout their lifetime, the Zenda is traditionally divided into two distinct books: the aforementioned Prophecy and the [gh_sazan_mahndazi|E]. This division, while practical, is ultimately arbitrary, as passages have shifted between the two over centuries of scholarly interpretation."
 
 game_concept_gh_sazan_mahndazi: "Sazān-e Mahndāzi"
 game_concept_gh_sazan_mahndazi_desc: "The [Glossary('Sazān-e Mahndāzi', 'GH_SAZAN_MAHNDAZI_GLOSS')] is the companion to the [gh_zenda|E], focusing on the Prophet's teachings on morality and virtue. Told in the same poetic and allegorical style, it contains rituals, parables, and songs. Together, the two books form the foundation of the Zaoranian faith."

 game_concept_gh_frazan: "Frazan"
 game_concept_gh_frazan_desc: "The Frazan are the Zaoranian priests. Their influence is felt across every level of life, from the smallest village to the imperial court.\n\nBecoming a Frazan requires years of rigorous education, starting at centers of learning, the most prominent in [amsar|E] being [Glossary('Unij-e Kahderz', 'GH_UNIJ_KAHDERZ_GLOSS')], which has long dominated the mainstream faith and its doctrines. The Frazan's role is both spiritual and practical, overseeing ceremonies, serving as religious leaders for their communities, advisors to rulers and sometimes mediating disputes."
 
 game_concept_gh_century_of_crisis: "Century of Crisis"
 game_concept_gh_century_of_crisis_desc: "The Century of Crisis refers to a tumultuous period in Amsari history marked by political fragmentation, economic decline, and widespread instability between 905 and 999 IS. It began with the outbreak of the Dirhad Fever in 905, which decimated a large part of the population and claimed the life of Qanamsar Bahran. Successions became increasingly violent, culminating in what is remembered as one of the most destructive events in [amsar|E]'s history, the civil war ignited by Zoen and Rexil, known as the [gh_scouring_of_amsar|E].\n\nAn infamous era defined by both internal strife and external threats, as neighboring powers took advantage of [amsar|E]'s weakened state to raid its borders."

 game_concept_gh_rham: "The Rham" #(Made by Pwsoap a while ago)
 game_concept_gh_rham_desc: "The Rham is the Amsari covenant to never engage in the evils of slavery. Every Amsari child learns this from birth, and as a result their culture has developed a deep and abiding pride in their status as free men and women. The very idea of enslavement is considered abhorrent to their society, something born of a nightmare conjured out of the darkest days of their history. One of the pacts of the covenant is that any slave who remains on [Concept('amsar','Amsari')|E] soil when the sun sets is immediately rendered free - though actual enforcement of this law upon those foreign merchants foolish enough to bring their slaves with them has been lax at best."

 game_concept_gh_first_siralagi_golden_age: "First Siralagi Golden Age"
 game_concept_gh_first_siralagi_golden_age_desc: "The First Golden Age of Siralagi Piracy, generally recognized by scholars as lasting from 500 to 569, marked an era of unprecedented prosperity for Siralagi cities. This period also saw some of the most famous figures of Siralagi history, including Mashtan 'Red-Hand' as well as the legendary voyages of Sina and Rimeh, the two most famous explorers in [amsar|E] history.\n\nBy the early 500s, Siralagi pirates had established Iskandur, a fortified outpost on the Three Sisters islands. It grew into a stronghold for raiders preying on merchant fleets and a staging ground for adventurers pushing further west. Siralagi ships harassed trade across [amsar|E], striking ever deeper into the Amsari Hiklahn and drawing the ire of the Qanamsar. Their growing influence, particularly their involvement with the Leviden city-states, would be their downfall.\n\nIn response, the Qanamsar expanded the imperial fleet, subdued the remaining independent Siralagi rulers, and tightened control over his vassals. In 569, after a prolonged siege, Iskandur fell. On the Qanamsar's orders, the city was razed, marking the end of Siralagi piracy's golden age."

 game_concept_gh_scouring_of_amsar: "The Scouring of Amsar"
 game_concept_gh_scouring_of_amsar_desc: "The Scouring of Amsar was the name given to the civil war that erupted during the [gh_century_of_crisis|E], a conflict that shattered what little peace [amsar|E] had known during the period. It began in 939 when Zoen and Rexil attempted to seize the throne in what became the most violent succession struggle to date.\n\nIn the dead of night, the two brothers and their conspirators attempted to assassinate their father, Qanamsar Yazarith. Zayal, the eldest son, rallied the surviving loyalists, and fighting broke out throughout the palace. By dawn, the streets of Tchouran were engulfed in bloodshed as rebel forces clashed with loyalists. Unable to hold the city, Zoen and Rexil retreated deeper into Western Amsar.\n\nThe rebellion quickly descended into madness as the brothers sought to annihilate their enemies by any means. Entire towns were sacrificed in rituals unseen since the days of old, their inhabitants vanishing in plumes of violet fire or sinking into pits of unraveling matter. The land would bear the scars for centuries to come."

 game_concept_gh_amsari_rebellion: "The Second Dawn" #The Great Uprising #Divine Retribution #The Awakening  #The First Fulfillment #
 game_concept_gh_amsari_rebellion_desc: "The Second Dawn refers to the great slave rebellion that erupted in [amsar|E] at the end of the 4th century, fulfilling what the Amsari saw as the divine will of Zaoran and bringing about the destruction of the [Glossary( 'Ran Kemsari', 'GH_RAN_KEMSARI_GLOSS' )], an empire that once spanned much of northwestern [sarradon|E].\n\nIn secret, the Amsari gathered weapons and mastered the [magic|E] of their oppressors. As foretold by [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E|l], they would rise from endless servitude in a great struggle.\n\nBefore the Kemsari could muster a proper response, the Amsari seized Wehydka'ha in what became known as the Battle of the Broken Chain and diverted the Heya River, the lifeblood of Kemsari civilization."

 game_concept_gh_massacre_of_the_ten_heirs: "Massacre of the Ten Heirs"
 game_concept_gh_massacre_of_the_ten_heirs_desc: "The Massacre of the Ten Heirs refers to the brutal execution ordered by Qanamsar Parashād in 1097 of his first ten children as well as their husbands and wives, to ensure that his youngest daughter would inherit the throne unchallenged. The exact role of his third wife, Nuya, is uncertain, though she was said to have an unusually strong influence on Parashād.\n\nThis would later result in the [gh_emerald_rebellion|E] almost two decades later."

 game_concept_gh_emerald_rebellion: "Emerald Rebellion"
 game_concept_gh_emerald_rebellion_desc: "The Emerald Rebellion erupted nearly two decades after the [gh_massacre_of_the_ten_heirs|E], led by Nashad, a man claiming to be the surviving son of Radesh, the late eldest son of Qanamsar Parashād, said to have been taken away from the slaughter. The name of the rebellion came from the crown he wore, adorned with emeralds, and the deep rich green garments he dressed in, in accordance with the Amsari tradition.\n\nHis supporters, composed of the dynasties of those executed in the massacre and powerful merchants discontent with Qanamsara Tovah's rule, rallied behind him, believing that the rightful line of Qanamsar had passed down to Nashad and his lineage. His defeat and death at the Battle of Tourma would bring the ultimate end of the movement he created."

 game_concept_gh_amsari_first_dreamers: "The First Dreamers"
 game_concept_gh_amsari_first_dreamers_desc: "The First Dreamers were the seven divine beings brought forth by Zaoran, He Who Is, before the creation of humanity. They were the first to walk the world, the first to witness the shaping of existence, they were as children and Zaoran would teach them. They carried Zaoran’s will, served as His emissaries, the shepherds of mortals. Iralya was said to be the most enlightened of them all and her death would began [gh_amsari_story_first_struggle|E]."  
 
 game_concept_gh_amsari_story_first_struggle: "The First Struggle"
 game_concept_gh_amsari_story_first_struggle_desc: "According to the [gh_zenda|E], the First Struggle marks the first act of discord in creation, when the balance of existence was shattered.\n\nZaoran brought forth the [gh_amsari_first_dreamers|E] to guide the world before and after the coming of mortals. Among them, was Iralya. She alone understood Zaoran’s will in a way that her brethren did not. The others sought her wisdom, and in their humility, she taught them. But her brother Belruk grew jealous, refusing to accept that another could see what he could not. Pride crept into his heart and Maiya fed his doubts. In a fit of rage, he struck Iralya down and the First Blood was spilled. Before her [Concept('gh_amsari_three_layers_soul','Core Soul')|E] could join Zaoran, creation trembled.\n\nThe wound of this act seeped into existence itself, forming Anvāhgar, the Bleeding Scar. Simultaniously, Maiya, in his hunger devoured the stars and so the world shattered and was made anew, as it did countless time after that."

 game_concept_gh_amsari_three_layers_soul: "The Three Layers of the Soul"
 game_concept_gh_amsari_three_layers_soul_desc: " In Zaoranian belief, every soul is composed of three layers, each defining the nature of existence and the journey beyond life.\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Body - The mortal shell, discarded in death.\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Burden - The experiences, emotions, and choices of life. This layer is shed after passing the [gh_amsari_mountain_of_souls|E] in Baizar Mana before the soul is reborn.\n\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$The Core - The pure essence of being, the eternal fragment of Zaoran’s breath that cannot be destroyed.\n\nThe Core Soul is eternal, returning to Zaoran only when freed from the cycle of existence. Until then, it moves through countless lives, shaped by the trials of the Burden and the fleeting form of the Body."
 
 game_concept_gh_amsari_mountain_of_souls: "The Mountain of Souls"
 game_concept_gh_amsari_mountain_of_souls_desc: "Sometimes called the 'Peak of Souls' is the final passage all must cross after death for Zaoranian believers, a place no being may reach before death. It is believed to exist somewhere in the [gh_amsari_realm_of_dreams|E]. Every soul must ascend its peak before entering Baizar Mana.\n\nThose who lived virtuously will see the way clearly, guided by the hand Zaoran along the way. Those who's journey remain incomplete will remain in Baizar Mana for an unknown time. Their soul is cleansed before returning to [aeras|E], the Waking World, in another form, unknowing of who they once were. And finally, those who lived sinfully will find no path. Their souls will be lost for eternity, wandering until the Last Struggle, when they will be unmade in pure agony.\n\nDuring this journey, the soul must endure Four Labors, trials that test its worth before it may ascend.\n\nTo Zaoranians the ultimate goal of the soul is to transcend the cycle by living virtuously, in complete accordance with Zaoran’s divine order. Only then will it no longer return to the world, instead dwelling for eternity in nearness of Zaoran."
 
 game_concept_gh_amsari_realm_of_dreams: "Realm of Dreams"
 game_concept_gh_amsari_realm_of_dreams_desc: "Also referred to as the Dream Plane, the Realm of Dreams is considered in Zaoranian cosmology to be adjacent to the Waking World. And separated from Baizar Mana only by Shāhmsur, the Endless Flow - a river that no mortal can cross, its waters being the essence of time itself.\n\nAt times, Shāhmsur overflows, spilling into the dreams of mortals. It is through these glimpses that people see what was, what will be, what could be, and what could have been.\n\nThe Realm of Dreams holds a central place in Amsari understanding of the world. Many individuals and scholars dedicate their lives to its study. As such [amsar|E] is considered a center of Dream Magic. Planewalkers are not uncommon, and the pursuit of knowledge in the field has always been seen as prestigious.\n\nIt is said that during their ten years of absence, [gh_the_amsari_prophet|E|l] dwelled in the Realm of Dreams, where Zaoran revealed to them the truths of existence and bade them drink from Shāhmsur."
