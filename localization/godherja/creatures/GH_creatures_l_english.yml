The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('chosen_hunt_game_var').GetFlagName,'_name'))] rips through my side, leaving a nasty gash across my abdomen though not deep enough to hit anything vital.

 aboleth_encyclopedia_desc: "Found in the Konijkmener marshes, the swamp leviathan is a massive eel-like monster. It is reputed to have the power to compel all manner of creatures, and unfortunate humans, to enter its domain and serve it as slave beings. The powerful [magic|E] that grants the creature its control over minds instils fear in all who wander the Konijkmener swamps, and few travelers find the rumours to be untrue."

 aboleth_intro_desc: "My party creep up into the swamp, aware that its creatures are watching us. The glazed eyes of the water rats around me remind me that the swamp leviathan lurks beneath my feet, waiting for the right moment to strike. I try to remind myself that I am the hunter, but the sight of a thousand eyes watching me from all around is disheartening.\n\nThe spear in my hand begins to shake, but I steady myself and take a few more steps. The creatures around me step forth too, waiting to see my intentions. The leviathan will raise itself eventually, to claim or kill me, and then I will drive my spear into its monstrous red eyes.

Though usually not exceeding the size of an adult human in diameter, they are nonetheless ferocious foes to face due to the wide variety of natural weapons and hunting tactics at their disposal - depending on the specific species, they are known to utilize razor-sharp spikes, powerful constricting tentacles, pack tactics, or any combination of the aforementioned to take down prey much larger than themselves."

 brittlestar_intro_desc: "Devouring brittlestars are not a particularly difficult marine predator to lure to shallow waters - even accidentally. Fishing villages often end up unwittingly attracting their attention, with packs of the creature becoming a major coastal menace to the locals.\n\nAfter some searching, we have spotted a huge devouring brittlestar resting mere feet below water, apparently not having taken notice of us yet. It is difficult to see which exact species this specimen belongs to, so what natural weapons it possesses and whether we can expect more of them in the vicinity is something we cannot ascertain yet."

The migratory camels are hearty creatures, well adapted for survival in the most hostile of environments. "

 camel_intro_desc: "The herd of camels that we have been shadowing has finally took up rest near a small watering hole, the only one we have seen for hours. We've walked for so long under the oppressive sun that I can feel the small bits of my exposed skin burning from the heat. The dune that we stand atop sinks around my feet as I climb down its slope to get a better view on the resting animals. I raise my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] and aim just below the mounds on a particular camel's back, one who is focused on a miniscule shrub struggling against the sands. I steady my breathing and squint hard at the beast. Some of the camels seem to notice my approach and rise from the sand, grunting threats at me. If I do don't take the chance now, we might lose the herd if they run. "

I struggle and climb my way after the injured beast and spy it stumbling through the sands some distance from me. I ready once again, and aim at the beast- the sun nearly blinding my eyes as I fire, and the camel collapses. I take my time trekking towards it corpse, and enjoy the heat just a little more as I skin the camel's hide."

I struggle to climb my way up a sand dune the injured camel had crested and look across the horizon for its form.

While some believe the crownbirds and sunbirds have no relation, that has not stopped others from associating these large birds with the far more common, and smaller, species. On average, they stand as tall as a man, with wing span to match, though it cannot take flight. They primarily live in small groups and are relatively tame when left undisturbed, but will quickly descend on trespassers. Their sheer size and sharp claws make them incredibly dangerous, and travelers should avoid the birds as much as possible."

 crown_bird_intro_desc: "Through the scattered tree trunks of the dry field around us I spy the crimson feathers of the crownbird flutter in the wind. The bird has not noticed us, neither have the others nearby, each distracted by a bait that we had left throughout the trees hoping to find the beast. Close combat will be almost impossible because of its claws and speed, so we have set up a distance away with bows at the ready. My companions wait for my signal as we draw back and eye the red and golden backside of the king before us. If we are not quick, the bird could escape us, or even worse, descend upon us with bloodlust.\n\nI take a breath and take one more look at our prey."

They are well known for their destructive capabilities when encountered at sea, and sailors often tell of the wisps destroying entire fleets."

You do not bring swords and axes, but good arrows, and fine prisms of Konijkmener glass. It is said that the best way to take the creatures down is to connect the prisms to the crystal held within the wisp's form. It would be difficult to do this up close, but a well place arrow can do the trick.\n\nWe crouch low to the ground, hidden behind a rocky outcropping overlooking a spawning pool for the wisps. Several ghostly forms float above the water, swirling in the air. I can barely see the heart of the creature through their constant movement, and while we may get the first, the others will surely not go down so easy.

They are easily spotted because of their sheer size and height, so only an adventurer would be brave or foolish enough to go near them. Since they are physically formidable yet exceptionally unintelligent, the best course of action to defeating one is deceit.\n\nAll thoughts about plans fade from my mind when we spot one from a distance ripping apart a cow carcass, and as we get closer we see that they are resting across a river - it most likely won't be long till they wake. I am starting to doubt our chances."

However, some species are known to grow to such massive proportions that their preferred prey consists of beasts such as camels, and represent a very real threat to unlucky humans that wander into their territory."

 devouring_worm_intro_desc: "The Devouring Worm is one of the more terrifying creatures to stalk the deserts of this world. Many tend to be small, only a foot or two in length and as thick as a string of sausages, but some are known to grow large enough to devour a man. They burrow under the sands waiting for prey, then they spring out of the ground, swallow as much as possible, and dive back beneath the sands to devour and digest their meal.\n\nDangerous as they are, they are not impossible to hunt. I walk through the desert, with several nervous attendants in front of me, hitting the ground in front of us with bags of weights tied to long poles. With any luck, a large worm will think it's prey walking across and spring out of the ground to grab it, and my trusty spear will finish the job.\n\nWe pause when we feel the sand shift underneath us, and I ready my spear. We've found a big one, the likes of which even [GetPlayer.GetFaith.HighGodName] has never seen, and it took the bait!"
 devouring_worm_victory_desc: "The worm springs from the ground, maw open as it tries to latch onto the bait. The young attendant thinks fast and jerks the bah upward, forcing the worm to rise even higher out of the sand. In under a second, about four feet of it are visible, perfectly vulnerable and exposed. I drive my spear into its body, pushing until the barbed tip emerges through the other side and holds fast.\n\nThe worm tries to sink back underground, but it obviously cannot escape. From then, it is simply a matter of holding the spear and waiting for it to stop struggling. When it is finally dead, we haul the beast to the surface to get a better look at it. Over ten feet long and nearly two feet wide, large enough to swallow a child whole!\n\nThe attendants heft the carcass on their shoulders, and we start walking back the way we came. This will #EMP certainly#! make for a good conversation starter when I get home."
 devouring_worm_defeat_injury_desc: "The worm springs from the ground, but not where we thought it would. In an instant, I lose my balance, and I feel something warm and slimy gliding up my leg. I look down, and I see the lips of a large worm's mouth wrapped firmly around my thigh.\n\nOnce the initial shock passes, I pull a knife from my scabbard and start slashing at the worm's hide. The pain makes it panic and retreat downwards, its myriad sharp teeth digging into the flesh of my leg as it sinks. I howl in pain as I start to lose my balance, but I keep stabbing at it. Why won't this damn thing let go?!\n\nAt last, the beast relents and opens its mouth, slinking back underground and leaving naught but some bloodied dust on the surface. I extract my foot from the sand and look at my leg; it's covered in deep, bleeding lacerations from all sides, some going down to the bone, while me foot hangs limply below it. My attendants haphazardly bandage it as best as they can and carry me back the way we came, racing to get medical attention.\n\n"If we hurry, we might be able to save your foot, sire."#N RAN OUT OF TIME SORRY PATRONS COMING SOON XOXOXO#!"

All that emerges from my mouth is a hideous scream as I slip beneath the sands.\n\nI cannot have sunk far, only a foot or two below the surface. But I cannot see or hear anything, and all I feel is pain as the beast's teeth tear at the flesh of my legs. I am vaguely aware of the vibrations of frantic digging above me. As my mind struggles to stay awake and I begin to feel very cold, I wonder how much of me will be left for the attendants to find."

 dire_crab_encyclopedia_desc: "Though chiefly deep-water animals, some dire crab species are known to seasonally migrate to shallow waters or outright live most of their lifespans on sandy beaches and rocky coasts, though hunting has significantly reduced their populations in areas with large-scale human habitation."

 dire_crab_intro_desc: "There is no shortage of encounters with large crabs during our trek down the sandy coast, though only a scarce few are larger than a dog. Most retreat upon spotting us, and we don't bother pursuing - game of such trifling size is not what we are here for.\n\nEventually, however, we encounter one specimen that absolutely dwarfs anything we had seen previously - slightly larger than a wolf, this particular crab does not even seem to take note of our presence. Resting half-submerged within the water, it is likely to fight back with ferocity when provoked, so it would be best if the first few hits managed to kill or incapacitate it."
 dire_crab_victory_desc: "The dire crab begins raising its claw in a defensive posture as I approach, and I end up having only a scarce moment to deflect it as it snaps towards me. Thankfully, neither I nor my warhammer are pincered, and I manage to hit the oversized crustacean square in the front of its armor.\n\nThe hit is strong enough to completely shatter the exoskeleton and leave cracks all around the crab's body. The beast is left stunned and unable to mount a proper defense as I deliver a few more blows to finish it off, and I am left with a rather battered dire crab body as a reward for my efforts."
 dire_crab_defeat_injury_desc: "The dire crab begins raising its claw in a defensive posture as I approach, and I end up having only a scarce moment to deflect it as it snaps towards me. While I survive the assault unscathed, my warhammer is significantly less lucky - the crab pincers the handle and snaps it in two, rendering the weapon useless.\n\nApparently seeing that it is at an advantage, the dire crab lunges towards me as I try to desperately dodge its blows. Finally, just as I manage to take out my sword, the beast manages to deliver a powerful pincer to my abdomen, but I quickly retaliate by lopping off its claw. The crustacean decides to use this as an opportunity to make a fast retreat into the water, and probably for the better - my wound is fairly serious."
 dire_crab_defeat_death_desc: "The dire crab begins raising its claw in a defensive posture as I approach, and I do not have the time to properly dodge this attack. The crab pincers my abdomen, and I drop my weapon from the sheer shock of the pain. After a few moments it lets go, but I am left seriously wounded.\n\nApparently seeing that it is at an advantage, the dire crab lunges towards me as I try to desperately dodge its blows. Ultimately, however, it manages to land a critical blow and pincers my arm near the shoulder - leaving me without it.

 ## False Kraken ##

 animal_type_false_kraken: "false kraken"
 false_kraken_encyclopedia_desc: "The false kraken, or 'whaler's bane' is the largest known species of devouring brittlestar in the world, its titanic proportions allowing it to pose a threat even to mid-sized ships. Native to the northwestern isles of the Shattered Coast, the creature is a nocturnal predator that emerges from its abyssal habitat during nighttime to hunt more shallow-water fauna such as whales, sharks and unwitting ships (likely due to a simple case of mistaken identity) before retreating to its dark abode come morning."

 false_kraken_intro_desc: "Luring a false kraken to the surface is a relatively straightforward business - one must do so during night time while operating over known whale hotspots, all the while trying to dump as much bait into the sea as possible. In fact, the much larger problem is usually finding a suitable ship whose captain is willing to embark on such a dangerous quest - after all, false krakens have earned their name for a reason.\n\nAfter days of night-time sailing and tossing pieces of whale carcass into the sea, we seem to have finally managed to attract the attention of a false kraken - our ship suddenly rocks so hard that it nearly tips sideways, and soon several huge tentacles rise from the sea and begin writhing across the deck. The crew of the ship frantically begin fighting back, and I brace myself for combat."

 ## Fortune Eater ##

 animal_type_fortune_eater: "fortune eater"
 fortune_eater_encyclopedia_desc: "The product of the lost Ojyczaynz art of soul-fusion, Fortune Eaters are amalgamations of dozens of spirits bound together by the power of a Duszkam stone, originally meant to guard the Ojyczaynz' vast necropoli from intruders, but over time reaching near-worldwide funerary popularity for the affluent. Any hapless adventurer that dies within the range of the stone has their soul fused into the ever-growing Fortune Eater bound to the Duszkam, forming a defense mechanism that only grows in power with age. The stone needs time to fully integrate any new souls into the collective, however, so mass sacrifices to quickly spawn a Fortune Eater are not practical.\n\nWith the [sorrowing_of_oejeynica|E], the art of producing Duszkam stones has become lost, but their several century long popularity across the world (with Kemsar being an especially ravenous importer) means that Fortune Eaters can be found guarding tombs and vaults in lands as far as Kathun-Kai."

 fortune_eater_intro_desc: "Any tomb-robber that has practiced the trade for long enough will have eventually encountered a Fortune Eater, and overcoming the challenge of defeating one is a mark of honor in the business. Unusually, today we are not primarily seeking what the Fortune Eater guards, but the monster itself.\n\n[GetPlayer.Custom('fortune_eater_location_intro')]\n\nTrying to directly defeat the spirit would be folly - instead, we will have to quickly locate and destroy or render inert the stone to which it is bound."
 fortune_eater_victory_desc: "As we enter the main chamber, the danger of this place is immediately evident. Skeletons and armor are strewn all across the floor, despite there being no obvious sign of their demise. We step inside and immediately begin our efforts to locate the Duszkam, ignoring the small hoard of treasure at the chamber's center. The sound of a slowly rising cacophony of ghostly voices heralds the appearance of the Fortune Eater. Within moments, a horrific ethereal monstrosity of countless mouths, eyes, heads and limbs manifests, its voices speaking to us in a mixture of pain, ecstasy, foreboding and excitement.\n\nI dodge attempts by the abomination to grab onto me, fighting through lesser spirits that have split off from the main body, and I can see that my companions are successfully holding their own line, too. Luckily, I locate the Duszkam quickly enough.[GetPlayer.Custom('fortune_eater_duszkam_outcome')]"

Rapidly, I realize that my position in this fight is becoming untenable, and I resolve to make a retreat. Only a third of our initial group manages to leave the chamber alive, and we can do naught but listen in horror the fate of the stragglers within that were unable to escape."

The Fortune Eater's lesser spirits completely overwhelm us in sheer numbers, and we are unable to even make a safe retreat. As I am fighting off the ghostly hands surrounding me, I realize in utter horror that the main body of the Fortune Eater has approached me. A mixture of blood-freezing cold, extreme pain across my entire body and vertigo overwhelms me as the abomination wraps itself around me and begins prying my soul from my body. Dying to a Fortune Eater - what did I do to deserve a fate this hellish!? I will have a very, very long time to ponder that question..."

 fortune_eater_duszkam_outcome_destroyed: "After a moment of trying to disable it, I realize that such a thing is beyond my skill, and instead raise my warhammer before bringing it down onto the stone. The result of shattering it is immediate - the Fortune Eater's voices all scream in unison, and the abomination disintegrates into nothingness within moments. The tomb's treasures are ours for the taking, but it is no doubt a shame that I was unable to get my hands on the Duszkam itself."
 fortune_eater_duszkam_outcome_disabled: "Putting all my mental strength into recalling the steps and incantations required to purge the stone, I manage to finish the quick spell just in the nick of time - the Fortune Eater was about to lunge at me, but the stone releases a bright flash, and the Fortune Eater's voices all scream in unison, the abomination disintegrating into nothingness within moments. We're left to plunder the tomb's treasures and — perhaps even more excitingly — I now have an intact Duszkam stone in my possession!"
 fortune_eater_intro_location_generic: "The perimeter of the tomb we have located is otherwise unremarkable and lacks defensive measures - suspicious, considering a long history of adventurers entering, only to never reemerge. This, in addition to the fact that historical records indicate that the structure dates from the period of the Duszkam stones' highest popularity, means that it is very likely that the vault is guarded by a Fortune Eater."
 fortune_eater_intro_location_mayikprolollan: "According to our research, this vault of the [mayikrata|E] has, among other things, been used to store a Duszkam. It is fairly unlikely that the Fortune Eater within was purged, and though the academy would've certainly surrounded the stone with protective wards, years of neglect mean that they have faded into impotence by now."

 hammerhead_encyclopedia_desc: "Guardian hammerheads are large sharks that live throughout the crystalline reefs of the Rocks of Guillate. These hammerheads are well known for their territorial nature and aggressiveness when encountered. Much of the reefs are protected by these sharks, making mining the crystals a dangerous task. Their unique, triangular heads have a cap on the front made of hard bone and fragments of crystals that the hammerheads will use to ram into the bottom of ships in an attempt to smash it into pieces. If it was not for their small territories just around the reefs, many sailors believe the guardians would make sea travel almost impossible throughout the isles."

 hammerhead_intro_desc: "While we are still some distance from the nearest peaks of crystal that jut out from the ocean waves, I can see the large fin of our prey just the same. The guardian hammerhead floats in the water between us and the crystals, ready to strike if we get too close. Luckily we have brought several rope-tied harpoons just for this, in hopes to pierce the shark from a distance before it's able to smash into our boat.\n\nAs we grow closer and closer, the hammerheads movement becomes erratic. We'll need to attack soon before it gets too aggressive, otherwise it might try to drown us."

The seahorse has yet to notice our presence as it plays in the water splashing sea foam into the air and kicking at the nearby fish. They may not be aggressive, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous. If we're able to catch the beast in our netting and drag it out of the water, it will make finishing the seahorse off far easier. I just hope that our strength is up to the task."

Often thought to be dragonkin, there are endless myths and misconceptions about the beasts that circulate through [aeras|E].

The heads also do actually grow back, but only after a few days of rest, and hydra can die from blood loss just like most other beasts."

The heads also do actually grow back, but only after a few days of rest, and hydra can die from blood loss just like most other beasts.\n\nWe have slowly tracked this one to its lair after weeks of following its trail, made especially difficult because they are aquatic beasts that prefer to dwell in rivers and swampy areas. It is an ambush predator, and finding it in the first place has been half the hell. Now we know it waits in the marsh ahead of our small boat, we merely need to pick out the heads, stab a few, and bait the rest onto land. Of course, actually finding the heads is an issue, and if we don't pick out the right ones...\n\nI force myself not to think of such things as we approach. We merely must kill the beast before it retreats, or else it will recover within days."
 hydra_victory_desc: "Our small boat slowly approaches the center of the bog we know the beast to be in, the silhouettes of our companions visible just beyond the treeline where they silently wait for us to trick the beast onto dry land. Our eyes are sharp, and the rowers careful not to touch anything besides water, and to try their level best to prevent the boat from making any significant waves as we approach.\n\nI stand at the prow, holding my spear up as I wait to see the great peak of the beast's head. It'd never get close enough to land to be attacked from it, so this insanity is the only possible way to attract it to the attack... and then I see it! The scaly head, the murky form, the distant silhouettes of the other two! I breathe out my relief silently, as I hadn't wanted to admit that even I would have been nervous about fighting so many.\n\nI give a nod to one of my fellow hunters, only for one of them to give a whispered shout and point at three other unmoving forms that rest just above the water. So it isn't a three-headed hydra. All the pity for that makes this far more difficult. With another nod, my two men and I thrust our spears downward, and the moment they bite into the beast's brains, the rowers paddle us out like hell itself is behind them.\n\nThis isn't entirely inaccurate, as three massive screeching heads come snapping out at me from within the waves with all the anger of a furious trio of gods. They are biting and snarling after us, and we just barely fend them off with a few well-placed jabs before the boat drifts into the shallows and we all live from it before the beast gets in a lucky strike.\n\nThe next is the most difficult part of hunting a hydra, angering the beast enough to make it give chase, doing enough damage that we could secure a victory before it uses its more desperate attacks, and doing enough damage while also not scaring it too much so that it doesn't disappear down the river.\n\nSome men cheer as we run from the shoreline, the beast charging out of the water with a furious roar that tells me it is quite intent on avenging its other heads. The other men from the trees run out then, several arrows flying and impacting the beast on its less armored underbelly.\n\nThe hydra realizes its mistake immediately, but more men are running to the other side of the river now, and others move to cut off its escape. We rush forward then, most of us trying to reach its exposed stomach, but constantly being rebuffed by the heads. One of my men manages a lucky swipe with their axe which bites deep down into one of the head's, black ichor shooting out in a jet which coats the warrior. He stumbles away screaming, the blood burning through his skin and exposing bone.\n\nAs its final two heads roar in panic, the gaseous bladder underneath its stomach deflates and from its mouth comes out plumes of toxic gas. I rush forward as my companions stumble away, just barely avoiding the cloud and ducking under its distracted heads. Spear in hand, I rush forward as it reels back, and slam the head home, deep into its heart. The hydra screams in agony as it stumbles away, before finally collapsing on the riverfront, several of its heads splashing down as my men cheer."

Each tip slides between hard scales and jerks down into the soft insides. Me and the others laugh for a moment as the heads sink below the water.\n\nAnd then we scream as three more thrust upward with great jets of water, their reptilian maws screaming in anger as they thrust forward at us to avenge their comrades. I brace my spear to meet it but it nimbly dodges it and instead goes for our boat.\n\nI only have a second to react as the boat bursts below me, throwing me into the air where one of the head's catches my leg. In my panic I somehow grab my spear just above the head and thrust it down into one of its eyes, and the hydra lets out a roar and sends me flying. Despite the pain I am actually thankful, for while I am breaking bones on the impact, if the beast had bit down instead of screamed then it would have easily bisected me.\n\nMy men in the treeline drag me back as I moan in pain, and I can see the hydra diving back below the water and swimming off from danger. No doubt it will recover in a few days, and I would be loath to find myself anywhere near here when it does."

The entire boat rocks back, several of my hunters spilling off the side as I struggle to join them. I give a shout for the rowers to get us the hell out of the bog when the first head comes snapping forward with a reptilian growl. I barely duck under, only to realize the beast had performed a feint. One of its other heads slams into my side and I scream before falling into the disgusting water.\n\nI struggle to swim upwards and towards the shore, not interested in anything at this point besides survival, when a horrible appendage whips through the water and bites down on my legs. Water rushes into my mouth as I scream in pain, and then I'm up and out of the water, and soaring through the air.\n\nFor a moment the beast releases me, sailing in an arc towards the water, when another head snaps out and clamps down on both legs. I only have a moment to feel the pain before it slams me downward and into several of my men who have remained hiding in the treeline."

 ## Karankoncolos ##
 karankoncolos_name: "Karankoncolos"

 animal_type_karankoncolos: "karankoncolos"
 karankoncolos_encyclopedia_desc: "Karankoncolos are similar in appearance to that of a man, with larger arms and a second, smaller set connected at the hips that act as their legs. They are said to hunt in packs in #BOL Aironoi#! and survive by dragging their prey into the earth, where they feed. They are not intelligent creatures, but their pack mentality is strong."

 karankoncolos_intro_desc: "We've followed scant rumors and stories to a barren strip of land tucked between the mountains. These flats are said to be something of a hunting ground for the karankoncolos- stories of travelers disappearing into the dirt are almost too common in the nearby villages. Tales of ghouls lurking in the night, taking cattle. We dismount and tie our mounts to a boulder laying at the nearest mountain's feet, and ready our weapons. I scan the empty horizon, the sun setting behind us. Every step must be careful and calculated, lest the ghouls we hunt grab us from below the earth, and pull us to our deaths."
 karankoncolos_victory_desc: "We step lightly through the flats, my spear gripped tight enough to turn my knuckles white. The sun sinks under the horizon, only a burnt orange haze hangs through the sky. Wind beats against me, howling into my ears from across the plains. I glance at my companions as we walk, my eyes keen for any disturbances in the dirt underfoot. We enter what seems a bowl in the flats, a soft ridge and smooth incline slide downward to where a lone tree has taken root. Just to the left of its roots, the soil moves ever so lightly I almost do not notice. I motion to my companions and we encircle the tree, the tension feels so taut in my limbs that a crow might even frighten me now.\n\nSuddenly, we hear our mounts wailing from where we had tied them and sprint back in case it were the karankoncolos. I can see the top half of one being dragged into the dirt with a frightened scream as massive arms, two times that of a man, grab the poor beast by its neck and pulls deeper. I dash for the monster, spear ready to pierce through whatever I can hit, when something catches my foot and sends me sprawling onto the ground. I turn to look and see our prey in all its deformity- a disgusting mistake for a human face stares at me with its mouth wide open, a gurgle of black bile spilling from between its teeth. Against the setting sun, its massive arms look burnt and scared, and far too similar to mine own. I swing my spear around and point it at the beasts neck, kicking into its gut at the same time to avoid being dragged too deep. With a furious scream I lunge into the karankoncolos, the beast tries to grab hold of my spear with another hand it had hidden, but it is far too slow. I pierce through its gullet, a sickly ichor spilling from the wound. The creature reels and tries to dig back into the earth, but I grab hold of its neck and pull as I climb back from its shallow hole. The karankoncolos howls against me as its neck skin rips around its wounds, and manages to graze me with its larger, muscular hands, scratching a wound into my arm. My companions have managed to light torches, scaring off our other attackers, and once they see me and my prey break from the dirt, they quickly set upon the beast with blades and fire. The karankoncolos screams and wails as it dies in the dirt, and once the last of its strength has drained from its velicose veins, I wrench my dagger through its neck wound and cut its head free. A howl hangs in the air around us, and we make haste back to our mounts, and out of the flats."

We enter what seems a bowl in the flats, a soft ridge and smooth incline slide downward to where a lone tree has taken root. Just to the left of its roots, the soil moves ever so lightly I almost do not notice. I motion to my companions and we encircle the tree, the tension feels so taut in my limbs that a crow might even frighten me now.\n\nSuddenly, we hear our mounts wailing from where we had tied them and sprint back in case it were the karankoncolos. I can see the top half of one being dragged into the dirt with a frightened scream as massive arms, two times that of a man, grab the poor beast by its neck and pulls deeper. I dash for the monster, spear ready to pierce through whatever I can hit, when something catches my foot and sends me sprawling onto the ground. I turn to look and see our prey in all its deformity- a disgusting mistake for a human face stares at me with its mouth wide open, a gurgle of black bile spilling from between its teeth. Against the setting sun, its massive arms look burnt and scared, and far too similar to mine own. I try to bring my spear around to stab into my attacker, and scream for my companions aid. Out of the corner of my eye, I see one get dragged down, and know no help will come. With a grit in my teeth, I stab with all I can into the karankoncolos, barely managing to pierce its lower abdomen before another hand grabs hold of my spear. The monster recoils from me, screaming into my ears as it tunnels back under the dirt. I scramble up from the ground, and run to the remaining mounts, my companions quickly following, as we try to escape from the flats."

 ## Manzaširi ##
 manzasiri_name: "Manzaširi"

 animal_type_manzasiri: "manzaširi"
 manzasiri_encyclopedia_desc: "Manzaširi are giants made of volcanic rock, commonly obsidian, that are said to roam the canyons and passes that divide Aironoi from the Redlands, though in recent times they have spread further into the steppe. Outsiders to the region that have survived encounters with the giants often confused them with golems due to their appearance, though little else aligns. They are far from compassionate nor caring beings, often seeming apathetic and outright cruel to the world around them. Folk tales speak of the giant that tried to the eat the sun, but was cast down, and never grew past its contempt for the gods that denied it its pleasure."

 manzasiri_intro_desc: "The Manzaširi is said to be a giant made of volcanic rock that trudges through the rocky canyons that border the #BOL Redlands#! to Aironoi's south. The scant few locals of the region either refused to speak to us, or couldn't quite understand what we were hunting, until a hermit insisted we follow him to his home. We did so, crossing over a hill where the dirt and sand have mixed into a burnt orange. Before us, a small shack made of mudbrick sits beneath a domineering plataeu split through its middle. The hut resembles an ant crawling underfoot against the sheer rock face. The man speaks of the Manzaširi taking roost in the ravine that separates the plateau before us, and offers his land for camping through the night. We accept, and prepare throughout the night, oiling our weapons and checking our armor for weaknesses. The plan is to take the Manzaširi from the rear, knocking it down to the ground and shattering its hard exterior with blunt weaponry until its heart leaks into the sand. These giants are said to be ferocious and bloodthirsty, so if we wish to claim victory tomorrow, we must be the same. Otherwise, the giant will crush us beneath its foot."
 manzasiri_victory_desc: "The morning sun had just crept over the horizon when we set out into the canyon. A haze hung high above the rocks on our approach, but by the time we entered the pass, the sky had turned almost violet in its discoloration. The pass itself was large enough to fit nearly a dozen mounts through it, shoulder to shoulder, yet its sheer height on either side of us still managed to make me feel uneasy. A low hum brushes the rock walls around us as we step deeper, the crunch of brittle dirt beneath our feet the only other sound to be heard. Larger boulders dot the divided plateau, forcing us to climb over and through them to go any further to our goal. A layer of sweat sticks to me throughout, as if the heat is rising as we go. The low hum feels stronger this far into the rocks. I struggle to the top of a particularly large boulder and spy a beautiful, obsidian monument far ahead of us, and point it out to my companions. I slide down, briefly thinking that the monument could be just that, but remember the tale the hermit spoke of the Manzaširi being darker than the night sky, and ready my hammer.\n\nWe dart from behind the rocks, blunt instruments swung far behind us to carry our momentum into the manzasiris side with fury. They connect with the giant's hardened exterior, shattering its limb into a glittering haze of obsidian shards that shower us. I roll to the side to avoid the rain of daggers, though some still manage to leave open wounds across my body. The manzasiri roars, shaking the very walls around us as its legs nearly buckle beneath it. I swing my hammer as I come out of the roll, aiming for what I think is the colossus' knee cap, and land my blow with a resounding whack that splinters the sleek rock. I move backwards to avoid the manzasiri's fall, the towering figure sending a shockwave through the ground as it lands in the dirt that knocks me and my companions off our feet. With an outreached hand, the giant manages to grab my lower half, but I scramble free from its grip before it has time to crush me into juice, and slam its hand back into the dirt before walloping on its back side. My companions take a moment to recover from the shockwave before joining me in cracking the giant's chest, all of us sending splinters and breaks through the black rock as the walls and earth around us seem to vibrate with the pain in the manzasiri's voice. I raise my hammer high above me and throw all I have into its swing downwards, punching through the rock once and for all. My hammer becomes stuck in the manzasiri's backside, and I as try to pull it free, lava begins to pool out of the wound. My hammer melts almost immediately into the molten rock, the manzasiri purging more from its mouth that spreads around its dying form. I quickly grab large shards before the heat becomes too much to bear, and we make way for the pass' entrance, victorious."

Just as I think I'm about to be ripped in two, the ringing of iron against rock and another splash of deadly, black needles send me to freedom as my companion's shatter the giants arm. I can feel a daze filling my head as blood seeps from the many wounds its shards have left, and my fellows look none the better. The manzaširi begins to climb up from the dirt, but with no strength left to fight, we quickly flee for the pass' mouth, hoping to escape death."

I can feel my bones break and snap as my body is used as a weapon, and all I can do is choke on my blood."

With a humanoid upper half that resembles a pale and misshaped man, and a black scaled tail, the merbeast preys upon waters both shallow and deep. While their disruption to fishing is little more than a nuisance to coastal communities, lone sailors often disappear in the waters of the swift and insatiable merbeast."

 merbeast_intro_desc: "The Merbeasts that lurk in the island waters are often said to have teeth like knives and venom sacks beneath their chins that spew a corrosive substance onto their victims. Whilst the challenge of facing such a creature does not elude me, I know one weakness that makes my task easier: its intelligence, or lack thereof. Whilst they bear a passing resemblance to humans, merbeasts are no more intelligent than the average fish.\n\nMy party have located this particular Merbeast after finding the wreck of a small fishing boat on the shore. The Merbeast awaits us within, the signs of a faceless cadaver being devoured within made clear by both the sickening slurping sound of the creature and the smell of burnt flesh. It may not be aware of my presence, but it is still a beast of similar strength to a man with the ferocity of a baser creature.\n\nWith my weapons by my side, it is time to enter the wreckage and face the monster."

Cloaked in midnight feathers and fronted by a skeletal visage of bone and skin-piercing eyes, a Morrigna's appearance is a testament to death's inevitably, their cries like the tormented souls of the dead. So insatiable is a Morrigna's appetite for the dead that it is common Malcoisiac to bury bodies with thick layers of herbs and scents masking the smell of decay and preventing exhumation by their bone-white beaks. However, on its own a Morrigna serves no great threat instead coalescing into thick brooding clouds appearing like a singular death obsessed consciousness able to remove every morsel of flesh and bone in one swoop."

 morrigna_intro_desc: "Wherever there is death, there is a Morrigna. A fact worth remembering when hunting for one these winged fiend, a single waft of decay enough to alert a whole flock. And so we haul some old, rotten mare with us into the forest and wait, the day becoming night and the blissful chirps of birdlife falling into deathly silence. At first it is only the usual culprits which appear, rats, foxes and a whole host of insects; but just when that old Malcoisiac saying seems to have failed us, we hear it, the unmistakable cry of a Morrigna in all its horror."

Whilst few can claim to have seen the creatures, a nagual is often believed to have eyes as black as night and uneven fur that glows a sickening green above their black flesh. They are quick, powerful, and insurmountably relentless."

 nagual_intro_desc: "A roar behind me alerts me that I am no longer the hunter. I spin around to see nothing but an endless jungle swarming with everything except a Nagual. The creatures are said to be as large as men and to have claws the size of swords, but I cannot see it. I know that it is there, but the monster stalks me out of view. I gather my party more tightly around me, but no sign of the creature but its roar can be discerned.\n\nThe maddening jungle will prove a difficult place to make a stand against such a ferocious creature but running seems equally risky. Whilst I came to hunt the Nagual, I did not think that it would find me first. They are famous for their skill at climbing through the trees, killing their prey in a single pounce. I know of no weakness to be found, all true knowledge of the Nagual lost outside of the borders of Cyrat. A second roar makes my stomach groan with pain: my time is short, and I must make my choice."

 ostrich_intro_desc: "The sun burnt fields of the savannah around us sway against the wind as we watch a small flock of ostriches feed. Their long, featherless legs nearly blend into the surrounding grass, in contrast to their fuliginous bodies. We've kept a fair distance from their grazing, an ostrich is far too fast to catch and too dangerous to capture by hand, so an element of surprise is key to killing one. I ready my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] and crouch my way slowly through the grass towards a lone male who has wandered from the rest looking for meals. The creature has not noticed me yet as I aim down upon it."

The ostrich leaps and bounds through the grass towards me, my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] merely grazing its body as it raises one of its legs to kick me. I barely had time to move before it was upon me, a step backwards saving me from some of the force, as I'm kicked backwards into the grass.

They are known for being near-impossible to spot in the deep jungle, their dark fur blending into the canopy's shadows. Encountering them unprepared can easily spell doom for the unwary, for their great strength is another of their natural gifts."

 panther_intro_desc: "I move cautiously through the sweltering jungle, my eyes failing to pierce the endless green darkness beneath the thick canopy. Insects buzz in my ears, their unceasing hums drowning out all other sounds. I know the beast is near, somewhere through the darkness, the sun blocked out by the trees. I look around, head swiveling, left, right. I turn around. Is something moving back there? In the corner of my eye I see a shadow shift, and whirl to face it. Only a trick of the light, for here, I am in the beast's domain, ever vigilant for something which might be hunting me. Another shift, another swift turn, my eyes failing to pierce the blanket of shadow cast by the trees. And then, from behind a bush ahead of me, I hear a roar as a mass of dark fur springs towards me."
 panther_victory_desc: "I manage to sidestep the beast, scoring a hit along its side with my sword. The beast growls in pain, and turns to face me once more. The moment has come. It lashes at me with its claws, once, twice, before bounding forth once more, its terrible fangs bared. I raise my weapon as I again evade the beast, and manage to slash its hind leg, a wound which will certainly slow it.\n\nWith its new loss of speed, the beast tries its claws, and I score another hit upon one of its paws. Now visibly limping, the beast exerts its last efforts in an attempt to bite me, opening its mouth for my blade to pierce, a single strike into the creature's brain. Near-instantly, it falls limp, and I wipe the blood from my sword, before skillfully skinning the creature."

It lashes at me with its claws, once, twice, before bounding forth once more, its terrible fangs bared. I raise my weapon as I again evade the beast, and narrowly miss its hind leg, the beast turning to face me.\n\nAgain, the beast tries its claws, and I desperately manage to score a hit upon one of its paws. In anger and pain, the beast lunges for me, its unwounded claw slashing across my chest. As its weight presses upon me, I manage to swing my blade towards it, an uncoordinated strike that nonetheless hits the creature's foreleg. While it backs off, I scramble to my feet, only for the beast to withdraw into the forest's darkness."

My sword clatters, useless, to the ground, as I can feel hot breath on my face, the immense weight pinning me to the ground.\n\nThen, in an instant, it is over, and my mind explodes with pain before a rapid cut to darkness."

 ## Peacock ##
 peacock_name: "Peacock"

 animal_type_peacock: "peacock"
 peacock_encyclopedia_desc: "The common peacock is renowned for its beautiful feathers and somewhat ornery temperament. While this may make it a formidable opponent to gardeners and prospective menagerie owners across [aeras|E], to someone actually attempting to hunt and kill the bird it's a negligible threat."

 peacock_intro_desc: "The peacock is not particularly difficult to notice by virtue of its defining characteristic - its garish, colorful plumage. In fact, it positively stands out like a sore thumb amidst its surroundings. It appears not to have noticed me, and I ready my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))]."
 peacock_victory_desc: "The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] hits the bird right in its side, sending it flying frantically - half its own rapidly failing attempt at taking flight, half the force of the hit propelling it into motion. It quickly falls to the ground, however, thrashes for a few moments, and then expires.\n\nAs I approach to recover my kill, I marvel at the beauty of the bird, though now quite tainted by blood. Its tail feathers are an especial delight to look at, and I make sure to pluck a few to bring back home."
 peacock_escape_desc: "The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] misses by a wide bearth, and the bird is immediately alerted to my presence.

 ## Pegasus ##
 pegasus_name: "Pegasus"

 animal_type_pegasus: "pegasus"
 pegasus_encyclopedia_desc: "A curious type of winged horse native to the mountains of #BOL Amaghea#!, the pegasus is easily the most iconic beast of the region. They spend most of their lives leading solitary existences in mountain pastures, but seasonally fly down to the lowlands and come together in spectacular herds to breed."

 pegasus_intro_desc: "The pegasus seems like something straddling the border between legend and reality, but they are all too real, as people who have had ill encounters with one can confirm. They have all the speed, strength, and ferocity of a wild horse, combined with great soaring wings that allow them to flee—or attack—in any direction they choose. Due to their difficulty to tame or breed in captivity, as well as the position of their wings making it difficult to ride them like normal horses, they are only best to be kept as curiosities or hunted for sport. And today, it is the latter.\n\nI scramble up the path with my pages, traversing the hills that pegasi like to call home. The steep and uneven terrain is an obstacle that the winged beasts can navigate with ease, but there is nothing in this world that is indomitable to man.\n\nAhead of us, grazing on some grass by the path, stands a beautiful white stallion, wings folded along his sides as he grazes on some grasses along the edge of the path. Perfect! I nock an arrow, draw my bow, and take aim..."
 pegasus_victory_desc: "The arrow whizzes out of my hands and hits its mark right in the pegasus' neck. He whinnies in fear and quickly turns to take off, wings flapping as he takes off into the sky. But judging by the crimson pouring out of him and splashing on the rocks below, he doesn't seem like he'll make it far.\n\nMy pages and I follow the trail of blood, and soon my suspicions are proven correct a few hills over. The beast has crash-landed in a field, trying vainly to climb to his feet as he continues to gush blood. By the time I approach him, his movements have grown weaker, and my hunting knife makes sure that he won't suffer any longer.\n\nWith the pegasus slain, I safely cut the wings—thankfully undamaged and unmarred by blood—at their joints, which my pages dutifully wrap up and put away. Bringing home full-grown pair of wings like that will be the talk of the court for weeks to come!"
 pegasus_defeat_injury_desc: "The arrow whizzes out of my hands and buries itself in the pegasus' side. He whinnies in fear and unfurls his wings, but instead of making to flee, he instead turns towards us and charges!\n\n"My spear! My spear!" I cry, and a fumbling page scrambles to find it among my weapons. I loose another arrow at the beast, but it simply grazes his side and fails to stop him. He's getting closer and closer...\n\nAt the last second, the page thrusts the spear into my hands, and I point it right at the beast. Thankfully, he recognizes that charging toward something pointy means death, so he tries to take off—unfortunately, a bit too late. His hooves are still only a few feet off the ground when he passes over us, and once catches me squarely in the shoulder. I feel something pop as I hit the ground, and the wounded pegasus takes off unimpeded.\n\nMy pages help me to my feet, and we begin the long trek back to my camp. Judging by the throbbing pain in my shoulder that turns to a sharp stab when I raise my arm, it seems something was broken or dislocated. Oh joy."

He's getting closer and closer...\n\nAt the last moment, the page pulls out the spear and tries to hand it with me, but the incompetent oaf drops it on the ground. I bend down to grab as I realize that the pegasus is almost upon us! He tries to turn away and take off at the last second, but it's unfortunately a bit too late. I glance up to see his hooves heading right for my face–\n\nI briefly fade in and out of consciousness, a state only indicated by the searing pain all over my body. I can't even open one eye, and all the other sees is a blurry red mess. I feel my limbs grow numb and my ragged breaths growing weaker, but before I shuffle off my mortal coil, one last thought crosses my mind..."

 peluda_encyclopedia_desc: "The peluda is a quadrupedal, serpent-headed creature often found hunting along the rivers of [chevalie|E]. Its body, even larger than an ox, is covered in a thick sheet of green spines that from a layer of fur over its scaled skin, so thick and shaggy it is reputed that no weapon can pierce it. With long claws and a serrated tail, the peluda is the terror of the Marches' riverbanks."

 peluda_intro_desc: "My party have tracked a Peluda nesting beside a river, presumably a mother by the way it guards the heap of branches it lays in. Its shaggy coat glows a resplendent emerald in the light of the sun above us as it rests, but there is one serpentine on the river at all times. We creep even closer to prepare, careful to stay downwind and avoid its keen sense of smell.\n\nThe Peluda's coat will not allow me to reach anything vital, too thick to be pierced by any weapon I carry. Likewise, attacking its front will be equally risky; any attempts against its head or neck will put me at the mercy of its razor teeth and its clawed feet. Its only true weakness is its tail, which although spined unlike its neck, is thin enough to be removed and vital enough to disorientate the beast.\n\nI signal to my party that the wind is changing: we will have to move soon."

The Pooka stares at us unblinkingly, 'I do not like men who say one thing but mean another' the creature says, before dropping from its perch on a branch and onto the forest floor.

It is then we hear a faint neighing in the distance and then the characteristic sulfur eyes of the Pooka appear this time on the face of a large, shaggy, horse-like beast. The creature is fast approaching, leaving me no choice but to make a stand. Hastily I brace myself against the ground, sword angled defensively against the charging creature. The Pooka's momentum is too great for it to stop its headlong rush, and it impales itself upon my blade."

 #animal_type_pyralis: "pyralis"
 pyralis_encyclopedia_desc: "#N RAN OUT OF TIME SORRY PATRONS COMING SOON XOXOXO#!"

 pyralis_intro_desc: "Pyralis are normally benign creatures, said to live and die within furnace flames across parts of [aeras|E]. Only able to survive and breed in fires, the strange creatures measure their lifespan in hours and will quickly burn to ash when outside of one. Their eggs, however, can survive for decades with fire and are so small that they are nearly impossible for humans to see. They have little interest in humans, however, and they have long been valued as parts of exotic toys ([Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] [magi|E] famously would make jars holding undying fires filled with pyralis colonies as gifts for children) or as central parts of festivals where many Aversarians consider the releasing of thousands through a running wall of flame to be a cultural cornerstone.\n\nHowever, pyralis only grow so large that the human eye can barely make their shapes out. Archexir pyralis are the exception, however. When a Magi creates a magical flame in a pyralis furnace, the flames sometimes cause extremely odd mutations upon pyralis. The most common result is the archexir pyralis, a giant version of the insect the size of a horse and with the ability to breathe fire. Even worse, it is said the heat of its shell is so hot that pyralis can survive along its skin, and thousands will swarm any would-be attackers threatening their nest.\n\nThe beasts are relatively rare, avoid human contact, and alchemists treasure the medicinal and magical uses of their bodies. This means that finding them is actually difficult as local authorities hunt them from the wild before they can start a forest fire and as local villages collect great profits on their corpses. It took some dedicated searching but eventually, however, luck eventually made herself known to us. After spotting the drifting blue light in the distance and the flames slowly spreading over the forest, we were quick to rush in."
 pyralis_victory_desc: "Archexir pyralis almost go nowhere without starting a fire, and sighting one can be incredibly difficult before other hunters descend on the beast. The moment we saw a distant forest fire, we dove headfirst, despite most recommending against such actions. I am thankful when we see the blue glow in the distance, as I had become afraid that the beast had been in our head the entire time.\n\nThe most important thing to remember when fighting an archexir pyralis is that the beast might now be the size of a horse but still possess a primitive brain the size of a child's fist. It doesn't attack with grace or agility, it desperately buzzes around and discharges flames from overheating with no actual accuracy, and while its stinger is deadly, it hardly knows how to manipulate the thing. It only takes a few minutes of battle, but soon the beast zips straight into the ground and curls in on itself in death, the thousands of tiny red lights around it zipping out of existence in a magnificent and... sorrowing show of lights."

I am thankful when we see the blue glow in the distance, as I had become afraid that the beast had been in our head the entire time.\n\nThe hunt is actually shockingly easy. The archexir pyralis is nimble and fast but surprisingly slow to react, their small insect minds not scaling well to their size, and their 'breath of fire' is actually more akin to a random outburst of it. Once one knows their movements and methods, it's quite easy to avoid the random bursts that seem less like an attack and more the creature attempting to let off excess heat. Despite the ease, however, the hunt comes to a horrible end when an arrow flies from the woods and impacts my leg! Local townspeople seemed to have caught up to the fire and attacked the winner, and we can do little besides retreat while they take our prize."

While one or two of the arrows embed themselves in the creature's chitin, however, most of them harmlessly bounce off. I stand horrified as the beast, a strange blue cross of a dragonfly and a dragon, twists around in the air and charges us. The one thing they didn't mention in all the tales was how fast the bastards are, or the massive stingers at the end of their tails. It is on me before I can even complain, spearing me through the gut with its stinger and then blasting me with fire for good measure, along with the thousands of its smaller cousins that bombard me."

Fledgling roc are almost indistinguishable with eagles however due to the roc's remarkable ability to continue growing until death; colossal specimen reverberating in legend for generations. It is not unknown for opportunistic roc to attack sailing ships or lay siege to fortified settlements, however such occurrences have become increasingly uncommon."

 roc_intro_desc: "The Roc resembles an eagle in all but size. Thought to continue growing until death, specimens can range from large birds of prey in their infancy to truly gargantuan beasts, capable of plucking whales out of the sea. Roc eggs are known for their remarkable taste, those who have had the pleasure to try one describing it as being unlike anything else on [aeras|E]. Not only is it a delicacy, but the destruction of Roc eggs is often decreed by law in realms they inhabit to counter their threat to livestock and rural villages. This Roc seems to be a juvenile, four to five horses in height - a challenge, but not one our men cannot overcome.\n\nThe Roc seems to be distracted by a nearby goat farm, giving us the perfect moment to strike. Cautiously, I approach, careful not to attract its attention. I draw my bow, aiming for its neck - but to my horror, it raises its neck to swallow a chunk of the animal it has perched upon just as the arrow is let loose.

My arrow strikes the base of its wing, causing it to lurch and start to fall out of the sky. Its following falcons scatter, but the beast is not dead yet. While it is unable to remain airborne, it seems it can still control its descent and it pivots toward me, claws and savage beak at the ready. I pull out my sword and make ready to counter its attack. The claws of the falcon hit my sword just as I swing the blade in front of me. It desperately flaps its wings, but my weapon strikes true, sending it to the ground. With a resolute finality I plunge my sword into its chest, putting an end to the fight."

I reach to pull out my sword with my other hand, but before I can draw steel the beast has taken flight once more. I breathe a sigh of relief that I must have appeared to be more trouble than it was worth to the Royal Falcon. While I did not get out of this fight with a kill, I was able to retreat with my life."
 royal_falcon_defeat_death_desc: "I loose my arrow and watch as it flies toward my target. The falcon, as if by a sixth sense, nimbly pivots in the air and dodges the shot. I don't have time to run, nor barely time to blink as it descends like a thunderbolt from the clear blue sky. It goes for my face first, so I am blind as I reach for my sword, and I am unable to grip it before the falcon knocks me to the ground and starts ripping at the rest of me. I attempt to struggle away, but that simply widens the wounds which it had torn with its claws. As I feel my control of my body slip away, I know this is where my life ends."

Though not poisonous like their terrestrial counterparts, their vicious telson, strong claws and impressive speed and agility when swimming more than make up for this deficiency."

 sea_scorpion_intro_desc: "One of the main challenges of hunting a sea scorpion is, like with many other marine predators, the practical impossibility of engaging one in combat without first drawing its attention. We have spent considerable time scouring the shallows in search of one, the clear waters thankfully allowing us to see a significant distance below.\n\nFinally, we spot our quarry basking on the sandy bottom below, apparently not having taken much note of our presence. Though it is difficult to discern the exact depth beneath us and therefore the scorpion's size, it is undoubtedly huge - at least as long as twice the height of the average man. We should think carefully before we goad this creature into a fight."

 ## Seal ##
 seal_name: "Seal"

 animal_type_seal: "seal"
 seal_encyclopedia_desc: "Somewhat comical in appearance, seals can be found sunning itself on beaches across [aeras|E]. It is usually found in colder locations, or in those areas whose waters are cooled by currents from the north. They are not very threatening, and smaller seals are sometimes hunter for their fur. The larger bulls of the species can, however, be quite dangerous to even a well equipped hunter and are usually avoided by fur hunters."

 seal_intro_desc: "Some local guides have led me and my party to a local beach where they claim seals can be found sunning themselves and raising their pups during certain times of the year. Sure enough we spot them easily as we crest the hill. I am honestly shocked by their numbers, there must be hundreds - perhaps even over a thousand - of the animals. Most are lazily sleeping, but on the edges I spot a pair of larger members of the herd roaring and slamming into each other with bone-jarring impacts. We set up camp downwind and begin to prepare for the hunt.\n\nNaturally my party and guides urge me to take one of the larger specimens, which the locals helpfully identify as the males. The beast looks too fat to be threatening, but I am assured that despite their comical appearance they are quite capable of bursts of speed, and with their bulk alone they can easily kill a man. "
 seal_victory_desc: "We approach one of the males lurking at the periphery of the herd while it sleeps, carefully skirting the sleeping herd. I ready my weapon and make the final approach. The bulky animal starts awake with my broad-bladed spear already deep inside its neck. It struggles fitfully but my strike was true, and in its panic it manages to nearly decapitate itself as it wrenches against the blade. The rest of the herd barely notices, and apart from a few nervous glances and warning calls we are able to drag my kill away for cleaning without raising the alarm."
 seal_defeat_injury_desc: "We wait until low tide and approach one of the males lurking further down the beach, at the edge of the herd. Our approach is undetected and I have high hopes for a smooth and expertly uneventful hunt until one of my party strays too close to a nursing cow who is less asleep than she seems. I am mere feet away from the bull when she lets off a loud whine, which quickly alerts the herd and my quarry. In desperation I dive forward, but the panicked twisting of my now alert prey causes the spear to merely gash a flesh wound into its protective blubber. The wounded animal flees rather than retaliate, and dashes into the surf with a speed that belies its bulk.\n\nI stand, shocked at this turn of events as the bull dives into the waves and quickly disappears from view. I only have a few seconds to contemplate this turn of events before the panicked shouting of my party brings my attention to an unexpected threat - a stampede of seals, near blinded by panic, now scoot themselves with surprising speed toward the waterline. It would be a comical sight if it weren't for the fact that I am now caught with no chance of escape between the two."

I clutch feebly at the wound, but can do little to stop as my lifeblood gushes out into the surf.\n\nPanicked by the roar of the male, the rest of the herd makes a desperate stampede into the waves. When the hunting party later recovers my body, it is broken almost beyond recognition, trampled by the panicked herd of seals."

Instead, we have followed folk tales, legends, and the reports of various merchants. There are probably hundreds of villages in Sarradon which claim to have a Shahmaran living in the nearby hills, but most of these are either complete fabrications or frightened villagers misattributing sightings of more mundane godtouched beasts. Suffice to say, we've spent most of our hunt in various states of frustration.\n\nBut that all ends today.\n\nMy hunters actually saw the damn thing we've been shadowing returning to its home, the ruins of a brick citadel perched over a long-dried riverbed in the arid highlands. They also reported what appeared to be a few inhabited dwellings a fair distance from the Shahmaran's lair - likely a [Concept('ritualism','Ritualist')|E] cult who I'd expect would be willing to die for their aloof "god". If we proceed, we're certain to be walking into dangerous fight."
 shahmaran_victory_desc: "We dodged the patrolling [Concept('ritualism','Ritualists')|E] under cover of darkness, noting their careful tracing of a perimeter that they clearly fear crossing. The Shahmaran has disciplined her unasked for worshippers well, evidenced by the charred and magically twisted skeletons we discover just a few yards inside that area. If the Ritualists spot us as we make the final approach, they do not give chase nor try to raise the alarm as we cross the threshold.\n\nWe enter the crumbling great hall, chased across the finely cut stone floor by the light of the rising sun. All manner of strange treasures adorn the chamber. Hills of discarded books and manuscripts tower between rows of enigmatic statues and rocks which veritably hum with power. I can already feel a slight wave of nausea that I guess must be the beginnings of mild [exposure_sickness|E].\n\nThe mistress of the citadel seems to have expected our approach, and is sitting imperiously in front of the hall's long-dead hearth. There is no preamble, no attempt at parlay or speech as happens in the tales. She simply begins to perform a series of arcane signs with her hands as my hunting party and I rush to take cover and close the distance before she can cast her first spell.\n\nThe fight was terrible, she slew most of the hunting party - and many of the dead are left without bodies for us to bury - but we have slain the Shahmaran, its lifeblood flowing fitfully around the blade of a great hunting spear lodged in her neck."

The pawmarks of a cat with a single twisted leg suddenly changed to those of a human, and then by uneven hoofmarks. Carefully, cautiously, we followed this trail, knowing that it might have left it deliberately so as to lead us on.\n\nWe have followed the markings over the course of several days, with the feeling of being watched causing all of us to shiver with fear. Occaisonally, I could see a distorted figure ahead of me in the distance, beyond the small circle of torchlight, but I am unsure if it is merely a figment of my imagination.

It grabs onto my spear from behind, and its thick arms reach around me, one seemingly attached to the body in reverse and with black markings running across it.

Some believe it to be benevolent, and will leave their dying babes at the foot of mountains for the simurgh to care for. Others, claim it to be ferocious, with the strength and power to hunt elephants. It is said to be a thousand years old, and when a simurgh reaches the end of its life, it will burst into flames.

 simurgh_intro_desc: "The Simurgh, or "Greatest of Eagles," to the locals that call this hot, dry land home, is said to be a beast of epic proportions. Villagers speak of its wings spreading wide enough to block out the sun, and that it is strong enough to carry off the heaviest of elephants! A wise woman told us the tale of a secluded mountain not far from here that is supposedly a Simurgh's home, though no one dare venture to check out of respect for the beast. There is said to be a spring where the bird raises the unwanted children of the region, parents leaving their deformed or dying newborns at the foothills of the mount in hopes of the Simurgh taking notice - and pity. The locals most definitely show reverence towards the monster, and the wise woman preemptively tries to dissuade us from hunting it. Nonetheless, we press on with our plan. We stock up on makeshift arrows attached to ropes and hooks, which will hopefully aid us in pinning our quarry to the ground and nullifying its greatest advantage. And copious supplies, of course - the long climb ahead of us is likely quite treacherous in and of itself."

As it grows closer, I have to crane my neck to look up into its fiery eyes and upon its strange face- like that of a feathered dog whose teeth were sharp as blades.

The beautiful colors and sickly sweet aromas begin to dry and fade before our very eyes, as the lifeless body of the Simurgh turns to tinder. I savagely cut what I can of the Simurgh's head before we're forced to run from the oasis, the desert seeping in to every crack and crevice, choking what life was once here. We run, back through the hidden tunnel with not a moment to lose as the cave network behind us collapses and we begin our rushed descent to the world below."

I struggle to crawl towards the tunnel entrance, only to find my companions ripped to shreds across the once emerald field. High above me, in the sky, I see the Simurgh drop something to the world below, flying into the distance. I have little choice but to run for my life."
 simurgh_defeat_death_desc: "After a long and arduous climb, we finally reach the end of our trek, arriving at what is supposed to be the lair of the Simurgh. I prepare my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] and steady my hands, taking a glance at my companions before stepping into the depths. The tunnel is a tight fit all the way through, the jagged walls slick with moisture. It does not take long until we breach the otherside of the tunnel into what can only be described as a paradise. The stark, beaten desert of the #BOL [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('temporary_hunt_biozone_variable').GetFlagName,'_name'))]#! does not seem to touch this oasis of emerald grass, and sapphire water. Colors flood my vision from every flowerbud and bush. Merely being in this place seems to sap the fatigue from my body - that is, until we see what calls this place home. Enormous paws, larger than that of a great lion, stamp their way through the trees and tall grass towards us. My eyes move upwards, following the frame and form of the Simrugh's feathered body. Its burnt, golden color radiantly shines as sunlight reflects off of its feathers, dazzling with every turn and move. A long tail of brilliant iridescense follows the Simurgh with every pounding step. It spreads its glorious wings before us, larger than any other beast that call the skies their domain. A single flap of its wings sends a gust of wind strong enough to push me backwards, as the Simurgh wails a piercing caw that drills deep into my ear drums before evaporating into harmony. As it grows closer, I have to crane my neck to look up into its fiery eyes and upon its strange face- like that of a feathered dog whose teeth were sharp as blades. It stares down upon us with the confidence of a king. I yell for my companions to fire upon the beast as I raise my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] high, aiming for the beast's neck.\n\nSome of my party struggles to raise their bows, their arms shaking in the socket.I raise mine high, aiming for the beast's neck, but before I can let loose it is already upon us. With barely a hint of effort, it swats me to the ground with its titanic paw, and beats its wings with such force that my companions are knocked hard into the rocky wall. I struggle under its weight, attempting to crawl away but am instead lifted off the ground, the Simurgh's claws digging into my back. One of my companions is being held in its other paw as it brings us over the peak of the mountain. The air in my throat seizes as I feel the Simurgh's claws retract from my back and I fall helplessly to the world below. . . "

Migratory groups of torkylls can be easily spotted at night along the wayline routes, though during the day they are near impossible to see with the naked eye.\n\nDespite their enchanting beauty, sailors avoid the torkylls at all costs. Many tales and omens tell of men and women being drawn to the sea and then dragged to watery graves by the beasts, and the simple act of touching one is dangerous enough due to the torkyll's highly toxic flesh and tentacles."

 torkyll_intro_desc: "Our small boat has rocked against gentle waves since the break of dawn as we sat and watched the sea. With night setting across the horizon, it became easier to understand how accurate the sailor's stories were. As the sun began to set, the sea around us illuminated with a cool, indigo light that shimmered atop the water. The darker night grew, the more apparent the shapes and forms of each individual torkyll became, until eventually our little dingy found itself in the middle of the entire flock.\n\nWith little time to lose as the blue sea spirits drifted past us in the direction of the Sea Tower, my comrades and I prepared our nettings and spears. Each of us fashioned long strips of cloth and leather around our hands and arms to avoid being touched by the torkyll, but that still may not prove enough with how many surround us. I watch with spear and net in hand, waiting for our moment to strike."

 vampire_encyclopedia_desc: "'Vampire' refers to a particular practice carried out by Living Magi in order to extend their lifespan at the expense of those around them. Aversarians consider the practice perfectly legal, though there are some regulations limiting a practitioner's depredations."

 vampire_intro_desc: "Regardless of how it is viewed in general, the kind of unsanctioned, predatory vampirism practised by my target makes [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('enemy_vampire_var').Char.GetHerHim] fair game to hunt down without fear of backlash. Indeed, the locals are more likely to be grateful than anything else - [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('enemy_vampire_var').Char.GetSheHe] has left a trail of dead villagers in [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('enemy_vampire_var').Char.GetHerHis] mad lust for blood and immortality, and has been a perpetual headache for some time - perhaps even decades.\n\nI approach the vampire's lair, [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('lair').GetFlagName,'_name'))], and ready my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('medium_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))].

 vampire_bat_encyclopedia_desc: "Vampire Bats are a common animal throughout the Central Isles. These large bats inhabit many of the caves scattered throughout the archipelago and feast on the large populations of migratory birds that travel through the region. While a single bat is usually not enough to kill a grown man, there have been incidents of children disappearing into their caves, never to return. The bats are remarked as vampires due to their hunger for fresh blood and meat, though they will scavenge scraps when necessary."

 ## Vendarja ##
 vendarja_name: "Vendarja"

 animal_type_vendarja: "vendarja"
 vendarja_encyclopedia_desc: "#N RAN OUT OF TIME SORRY PATRONS COMING SOON XOXOXO#!"

 vendarja_intro_desc: "Locals say that the illusive vendarja were once the rulers of ancient Kalathipsomi, but concentrated effort from the [Concept('marchers','Marcher')|E] [antimagi|E] and the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E] who later replaced them drove them to the very edges of civilization. The effort to do so was a long and gruelling century long affair, only aided because of the possibility that vendarjas do not breed and that their population is possibly static. The truth of this is one of many unknowns about the beasts, almost every single facet of their existence yet another mystery that scholars and monster-hunters have tried to divine for centuries.\n\nThey say ancient villagers would leave children out for the vendarja's taking as sacrifice, the beasts for unknown reason desiring youths and even apparently understanding human speech. What they do with the children is likewise unknown, as every time hunters have tracked down their lair there has not been a single trace of the youths, not even bones, not even if the vendarja had taken them only minutes prior.\n\nReports also claim that they carry a possibly human level intelligence, and seem to possess a deep and horrible cruelty and hatred of mankind. Hubris has led to them 'ruling' many villages offering tribute, but their hunger always takes over their pride, and eventually they always take and feed until none remain to give them homage. While none even know if they are a mutant, a species of animal, or physical manifestations of spirits, some have theorized that they do not actually need to eat. Instead, it appears as if the beasts somehow feed off... fear itself. To be hunted is their pleasure, for they almost always turn the hunt back around and devour those who chase them. It also means that our preparations have been esoteric and increasingly intricate at the [magi|E], MAGINAME's, suggestion.\n\nMAGINAME has prepared us as well as MAGISHEHE could. Before us in the clearing is a bound and screaming child with the signs of sacrifice. MAGISHEHE tells us that the illusion is the best we can expect, and that the vendarja should be fooled that the bound goat is a young boy until it gets close enough for us to be ambushed. Worst still, I know that it is pitch darkness out of our tunnel. The beast only takes its tribute precisely at midnight, not a moment before or after.\n\n"Once we arrive," MAGINAME states, "You will need to act with haste. If the beast gets the chance to ambush us, then this hunt will be over. Strike fast the moment you see it, strike for its heart, and do not let it get away no matter what you do. If you're brave and fast, then we'll survive." As MAGISHEHE finishes, the light from their hands dims away and they stop quietly tunneling through the underground with their spells. MAGISHEHE is silent before telling us MAGISHEHE feels its presence..."
 vendarja_victory_desc: "MAGINAME quickly gets to work, as we only have seconds until the vendarja discovers our trap or escapes with the bait. MAGISHEHE throws down ritual salts in a circle, says an incantation more quickly than any other Magi I've heard before, and then slams MAGIHERHIS hands into the ground. A second later and my stomach lurches as the ground below us launches upward, the ground above thankfully giving way to allow us through.\n\nWe jump into the clearing with weapons ready, RANDOMCOLOR magic bleeding off of MAGINAME's hands as we launch outward, and there stands our vendarja.\n\nWe are lucky that the beast was just where we had hoped. It is standing just above the goat, having already ripped the poor beast in half upon realizing our ruse. We each launch from the surrounding ground and dive in before it can escape our circle. It is an abomination. Its head is nothing but a deer's skull, and rotting, peeling flesh on their neck gives way to a dark imitation of a human form. It's unnaturally long limbs distend in ways their bones should not allow, and it easily stands at twice our height.\n\nBut we are many, and MAGINAME carries with MAGIHERHIM a litany of spells carried just for this moment.#N\n\n"Disgusting creatures!"#! shouts an ancient voice I do not recognize, though it is one that immediately sets my stomach to roil.#N "Manflesh and bone, fit for nothing besides labor! For work! For pleasure! I will rend you, I will flay you, I will devour you all! You dare rise against us!? You dare make pretensions against your betters!? You dare steal OUR gifts!?"#!\n\nIt swipes out with a huge, clawed hand, and it tears one of my footmen in half with a single claw. I blink through the gore as I charge in after slamming my spear upwards and taking it in the chest. What answers me immediately is a sickening screech that echoes in a thousand voices, both animal and human, the rest of my companions falling in after me.\n\nThe vendarja attempts to launch itself outward, but MAGINAME's chanting crescendos just as they do, and vines whip out of the ground and pull them back down by its ankles.#W\n\n"I am the aautokratir!"#! it screams.#W "I will rule this realm or I shall rule ash! Let that bitch in [GetTitleByKey('c_asiupoli').GetNameNoTier] burn with the rest! They'll all burn, all of them! You come to me speaking of mercy!? You try leveraging my own children against me!? No aautokratir may rule if they do not sacrifice! How can I ever claim to deserve the throne were I not willing to give it all!? I will give the realm itself to take its crown! Now draw the circle, Void Walker!"#!\n\nIts hands swing out again, and I only just miss a swing that sweeps over head with such force and fury that my clothes bellow out in the wind. It crushes two more of my men, and then the vines snap, and it launches itself outward.\n\nMidair in its jump, MAGINAME screams and runs forward, and a magnificent light blasts out from MAGIHISHER hands. MAGIHESHE stumbles back as their palms seem to burn from the energy, screaming in pain, but what appears to be a comet rockets out and slams into the vendarja's chest. It flies backward, screeching and screaming.#S\n\n"DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE,"#! a voice that is my own echoes.#P\n\n"WE NEED TO RUN!"#! it yells, mimicking one of my men to tempt us to scatter.#X\n\n"DADDY, IT'LL HURT ME!"#! screams the long-dead child of one of my men,#X "IF YOU KILL IT, IT SAYS IT WILL HURT ME. IT'S SPIRIT WILL HURT ME. DADDY PLEASE."#!\n\nEvery voice I can imagine ricochets across the valley. Every single one, and thousands yet that I could never have imagined. I struggle through the pain, both emotional and physical, and slam my spear downward and into its heart. The screech is so terrible that my head feels ready to split, and my men are soon piling down on it behind me, chopping it to bits as it throws several of my men across the clearing in its dying swipes.#W\n\n"I am Arthenax! Fear me! Worship me!"#! it screams out.#S\n\n"Torment! TORMENT! Eternal torment! My own guard!? My own slaves!? They desert for these rebels!? They shall know to fear Aerasod'yanax, they shall learn to fear their master! I will flay their souls and cause them hell for eternity! They shall never know peace!"#!\n\nI lift the spear for a last strike, barely ducking yet another swipe from the monster as it struggles to stand against the mutilation.#P\n\n"Please,"#! RELATIONNAME says to me,#P "Please, please, please don-"#!\n\nI slam the spear home and into its neck. The screech lasts a second before turning into desperate gurgling, and then it shrivels and curls up as its limbs snap and break to allow it to fold into a ball. Slowly it seems to burn and turn to ash, the body rotting away as if time was moving thousands of years a second, before nothing remains of it besides the deer skull that once served as its head.\n\nWe did it. We killed it. A vendarja dead. Even now, though, even now that it sits as nothing besides a disturbing skull, I can still hear it... I doubt I'll ever truly be able to forget this night."

We had launched out with the idea that we'd catch it looking down upon the goat where we could easily surround it. Instead, it hunches over under the gnarled branch of a tree, one hand above it gripping the wood and the other relaxed at its side. It is a horrible, twisted creature. Its head is nothing but a deer's skull, and rotting, peeling flesh on their neck gives way to a dark imitation of a human form. It's unnaturally long limbs distend in ways their bones should not allow, and it easily stands at twice our height.\n\nI let out a curse then, and immediately I am met with a sickening, horrifying laugh. There is a loud snap, and as one of my companion's charges forward, it tears the man-sized branch from the tree and launches it at HERHIM with such force that it caves in HERHIS chest.\n\n"You are my children,"#! a voice that I do not recognize echoes out, though I find it somehow familiar and deeply troubling,#P "All of you are born to Myself, all of you are part of Myself, I will be with you always. Remember that when you walk, so walks your Creator, know that when you die, you return to your Creator. Cry not odd tears of liquid, gasp not your self-made words of pity. Never fear."#! #N\n\n"MAGINAME,"#! it says,#N "It's me. I'm out here."#! It takes a moment for me to realize it is MAGINAME's actual voice repeating back at us.#N "Do not trust a word. Do not trust a word. Do not trust a word. I'm out here, I'm trapped out here. You're going to be trapped here. You're going to die. We're going to die. WE'RE GOING TO DIE."#!\n\nI don't believe we have ever been so afraid in our lives, but we persevere through what feels like hours of the baiting, taunting, and the endless laughter. It launches at us with a hundred screams, its huge limbs a flurry of claws ahead of me.\n\nIt rips one of my men nearly in half, and as I swing, it reaches down and throws the goat at me with full force. The screaming animal impacts me with the force of a horse, and I can feel broken ribs embed themselves into my organs as I slam against the ground. There is nothing but pain there, the voice of RELATIONNAME in my ear begging me to try to run.#W\n\n"I've waited!"#! another voice comes.#S\n\n"Thank you for coming,"#! says a pleasant and aristocratic man.#P\n\n"We missed you!"#! giggles a host of children.#N\n\n"YOU'RE GOING TO DIE,"#! screeches a distorted mimicry of myself.\n\nI close my eyes and accept my fate when I feel a hand grip my shoulder. MAGINAME is there, MAGIHISHER face covered in blood from a horrifying gash across MAGIHISHER face. Several of my companions huddle around as well, as the beast slaughters the rest in the clearing's center.\n\nMAGINAME says an incantation and then the ground swallows us, the twilight forest closing off above. I feint sometime then, MAGINAME guiding us as far away from here as they can manage. Even as I close my eyes, even as I lose consciousness, even as we travel well away and several spans underground, I can still hear that laughter. I don't think I'll ever be able to stop it from echoing through my mind."

The bait is there, and MAGINAME tells us in a panicked whisper that the beast#S is#! nearby. They stutter in their panic, and the words escape me until I grab MAGIHERHIS shoulders and shake MAGIHERHIM into a lick of sense.

A sickening screech then cut off the mimicry, and then deep and cruel laughter. My companions and I back closer to one another around the panicking goat, and I hear the rattling of all of our weapons and armor from our shaking bodies.\n\n"I can't do this! We need to go!" one of the MENWOMEN screams, and HESHE bolts out of formation despite our protests. They sprint into the bushes, and in a moment disappear into the twilight. All are silent as we try to listen, and then a sickening and horrified screech echoes through the forest.\n\n"Help! GODNAME help me! CHARNAME please! My TITLE, TITLECHARNAME, please by GODNAME help me!"\n\nOne of my legs moves forward when my companion's hand grips my shoulder, shaking their head no. A moment later and there's a bestial shout from just behind me.\n\nAnother companion acts faster than any of us, swinging around with HISHER axe and striking at the beast... but nothing is there. Instead, it embeds deeply within the neck of MAGINAME, who spits an outpouring of blood as they try to scream through the gurgling. HISHER hands ignite as they fall, HISHER spell discharging as HESHE collapses, and two of my companions scream in pain as the fire consumes them.#W\n\n"HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME"#! the first man screeches through the trees, their pitch even and clipped as if played back through some unnatural method. The sickening laugh follows a moment later.#P "Do not let it get away no matter what you do!"#! MAGINAME's voice echoes out from the forest.#S "CHARNAME, CHARNAME is that you!?"#! my own RELATION shouts afterwards.\n\n"Let's run! Run!" someone screams from behind me. I realize then that I don't know if it was one of my companions or if it was the beast, but then echoes the sound of bootsteps and screaming, and everyone is running. Sprinting. I break through the treeline and run as far as my legs can take me, trying to gain any distance I can from that horrifying place. No matter how far I run, how fast, how much I scream, the voices follow. Friends, family, enemies, my companions, MAGINAME. All of them getting more cruel, saying darker things, screaming in eldritch horror.\n\nSoon I am out of breath, sagging against a tree as I desperately attempt to suck in air. It's already there when I turn around. An antlered deer's skull with a neck of rotting and peeling flesh, its body a twisted abomination EVILGODNAME made just as mockery of the human form. It stands over twice my height, and its limbs ripple with unnatural sinews and muscles as it unfolds before me. All the voices laugh now, all of them cry, and I realize now that I never hunted this beast. It echoes back my voice then.#S\n\n"A vendarja,"#! I say,#S "I'll hunt a vendarja."#!\n\nIn my last seconds of life, I realize I had never hunted a vendarja, not from the moment I said those words, alone to myself in my study. From the moment I dedicated myself to it, the beast had eagerly awaited hunting#italic me#!."

 werewolf_name: "Werewolf"

 animal_type_werewolf: "werewolf"
 werewolf_encyclopedia_desc: "Believed by some to be a cursed bloodline, by others to be some kind of disease responding to the influence of [aervalr|E], lycanthropes inspire terror and paranoia throughout [aeras|E]. While younger sufferers of the curse are often seized by periods of extreme and uncontrollable bloodlust during their transformation, those who survive into old age seem capable of controlling both the timing of their change as well as their actions during it."

 werewolf_intro_desc: "[aervalr|E] shines down upon the clearing, a cloudless sky giving way to a pale green light. With the brightness, it is easy to see what is before me, seemingly only more grass. But I know better, for the beast I hunt is a cunning one, and a deadly one. And then I see it, the greenish glow illuminating a human-shaped creature, that seems increasingly wrong as one stares at it. It charges towards me from its distance, its teeth bared in a snarl, blood ringing its mouth. Its eyes shine across the distance, green pinpricks in sunken black pits. Feeling a chill run down my spine, I draw my sword, ready to bring this monster to its death as it barrels towards me."
 werewolf_victory_desc: "The beast spings towards me with a guttural growl, a noise which seems to embed fear within my very soul. But I harden my heart, and raise my silvered blade, the werewolf backing off after a few swings. I advance towards it, yelling and stabbing, until the creature changes tactics, running to the side in an attempt to catch me off-guard.\n\nI swing my sword sideways to catch the beast, and I hear its whimper of pain as it suffers a cut across the chest. With the wound weakening it, I need only move for the kill, and I make a furious charge towards it, attacking with my blade as it desperately parries with claws or dodges the swings, occaisonally suffering from glancing cuts. Soon, coated in blood, the werewolf's eyes begin to dim as its movement slows, and I manage a perfect swing into its arm, severing its right hand in a single blow. As it doubles over in pain, I raise my shining blade once more, and plunge it into the creature's shoulder. After one last, deafening howlte, the beast collapses to the ground."

But I harden my heart, and raise my silvered blade, the werewolf backing off after a few swings. I advance towards it, yelling and stabbing, until the creature changes tactics, running to the side in an attempt to catch me off-guard.\n\nI swing my sword sideways to catch the beast, and I feel only air as it rakes a claw along my side. I grunt in pain, and turn to face it, raising my sword with unsteady hands. Knowing I must take a risk to win, and I make a furious charge towards it, slashing with my sword only for the beast to knock it from my hands, the blade clattering to the ground. I dive for the weapon as the beast lunges for me, and manage to clutch the fallen sword, the wind of the werewolf's passage behind me. Desperately, I stab blindly towards it, and pierce through the shoulder. As it whimpers in pain, I raise my sword once more, and the beast turns and runs, a trail of blood following it under the green moon."

 ## Wild Hunt ##
 wildhunt_name: "Wild Hunt"

 animal_type_wildhunt: "wild hunt"
 #animal_type_wildhunt: "wildhunt"
 wildhunt_encyclopedia_desc: "Purportedly the cursed spirits of what was once [Concept('aversaria','Aversaria')|E]'s old Imperial Army's 'Sixth of Red' formation, the 'Wild Riders', the spectral phenomenon known as the Wild Hunt has haunted the plains and backwoods of Malcois for centuries, and its origin story is one of the most well-known fables of the region. Tasked almost exclusively with the hunting down of renegade slaves and quashing uprisings, the methods employed by the Wild Riders were so infamous for their viciousness that it had earned the division several imperial censures for 'Improper Conduct' (an exceptionally rare charge that it shares with only a select few other armies in Imperial history) during its existence. It would ultimately disappear from records in the 5th century IS, the number 'six' being banned from use in the Imperial Army and even thereafter in the Legions that replaced it; though the reasoning behind this move and whether it is related to their folk-tale demise is lost to time.\n\nFor all their cruelty and hubris, the Wild Riders would allegedly met a fittingly grisly end - cursed by the witch and outlaw Myra 'the Crow' with her last words to rise from the dead when [aervalr|E] was at its fullest and never know the rest of death. And so the Wild Hunt emerges as a ghostly horde terrorizing rural Malcois as they had done in their living heyday, sparing no human regardless of creed or caste from ghastly torments normally only thought possible in nightmares."

 wildhunt_intro_desc: "Purportedly the cursed spirits of what was once [Concept('aversaria','Aversaria')|E]'s fifty-first state legion, the spectral phenomenon known as the Wild Hunt has haunted the plains and backwoods of Malcois for centuries, and its origin story is one of the most well-known fables of the region. Cursed by the witch and outlaw Myra the Crow with her last words to rise from the dead when [aervalr|E] was at its fullest and never know the rest of death. And so the Wild Hunt emerges as a ghostly horde terrorizing rural Malcois as they had done in their living heyday, sparing no Aversarian, Iyrossi, or human in general from the ghastly torments normally only thought possible in nightmares. The Wild Hunt makes no effort to conceal itself instead burned farmsteads, smashed remains and ransacked villages are left scattered in its wake. At its head, the disgraced Legon Agros the Fierce is supposed to ride, his face obscured by an imposing antlered helm. Taking this wave of fury and steel head on would be suicide, instead to 'defeat' such a foe we will need to free them from the invisible chains, keeping them trapped among the living.\n\nTo approach this daunting task we have enlisted the help of a local shaman capable of identifying the source of a Wild Rider's curse, our surroundings becoming increasingly desolate as he, guided by spirits, leads us to the scene of this long-forgotten tragedy. Just as it seems we cannot get anymore isolated the shaman gets on his knees and touches the ground with his palm, the wind picking up and blowing violently through the leaves. We give the shaman a shovel and before long he lifts out a long, rusted chain presumably used to bind one of the Wild Riders' victims. As if the hunt can sense this however, our shouts of joy are turned to those of terror as the unmistakable sound of phantom hooves come thundering towards us. "
 wildhunt_victory_desc: "Our guide asks us to picture what we are searching for, closing her eyes and placing her palm on my forehead. I begin to imagine the Wild Hunt riding through open farmland and dark, undisturbed wood, not looking back as farmsteads are destroyed in furious flame. She lifts her hand from my head and begins to walk down the track, before stopping at the crossroads. "I require no coin" — she says, turning back on us — "Instead the solemn vow that you shall never seek an explanation for my methods. The ways of my people have been transmitted from mother to daughter for ages beyond count, and are not for the prying eyes of foreigners, hunters or soldiers." And with that she continues walking.\n\nAt times it feels like we have passed the same tree or signpost multiple times, but sticking to my word I remain silent. Suddenly at a point unremarkable in its isolation the magi places her hand on the ground and begins whistling, the wind picking up in accordance. We start digging in the spot, promptly finding some kind of doll and with it a single chain link, "you have found what you desire" the crone assures us, and then disappears into the night.\n\nAnd with that I hear it - the hooves of a dozen horses, their hide a translucent blue and their skeleton visible underneath. On each one rides a Wild Hunter, cladded head to toe in terrifying armor, hiding any sign of the person they once were.\n\nPanicked, I lift my hand in the air, the hunt stopping a mere foot away from me. What seems to be the leader of this particular band dismounts from their spectral horse and approaches me, lifting out an open palm. I drop the two items into their glove, and watch as the hunter inspects them with great intensity. Some kind of blueish essence then starts spiraling out the helmet's eyes as the hunter falls to their knees, and then suddenly their armor collapses to the ground, leaving no trace of the entity inside. The rest of the hunting party ready their horses and ride off into the distance."

Seeing an opportunity as it goes for another swing, I plunge my sword into the fold of its armor, the hunter staggering back and dropping its weapon, instead without any warning hitting me across the face with its gauntlet. A deluge of bones and blood pours forth from my face. Turning my eye back to my adversary, my face still resting on my hand, I see the hunter ride away, perhaps respecting my prowess or having pity on my soul."
