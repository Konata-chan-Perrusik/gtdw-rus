 artifact_skull:89 "Skull" 

 artifact_hunt.0001.a:89 "Time to go hunting!"
 artifact_hunt.0001.b:89 "Maybe some other time."
 artifact_hunt.0001.desc:89 "Through my recent exploits I have come across evidence of a possible item that has lain hidden to historians for some time. Of course, it could all be just a fanciful rumor, old wives' tales, or possibly even outright fabrications. Still, on the chance chat these whispers are true, I would be foolish to pass up the opportunity. Artifacts of historical note can be of massive value to those with an eye for it, and any ruler possessing one would no doubt be the talk of the land for much time to come. My mind fills with images of magnificent helms, gleaming and gilded swords, and breastplates beaten by only the most skilled hands of history. I feel as if I am holding them all even now..."
 artifact_hunt.0001.t:89 "The Hunt Begins"
 artifact_hunt.0002.a:89 "Good luck!"
 artifact_hunt.0002.b:89 "Perhaps I should save my gold for a more certain endeavor."
 artifact_hunt.0002.desc:89 "Why should I bother chasing down leads on what very well turn out to be a wild goose chase? I have so much more important, patently real issues to handle at court. I simply can't spare any time to personally look into rumors. That doesn't mean I have to ignore them however, because to do so could prove quite foolish indeed. Instead of heading out myself I have decided to hire some locals to do the searching for me. Hunters, trappers, veterans of past wars, people who ought to know the lay of the land. They'll be good and trustworthy as long as I pay them a fair amount in exchange for finding the artifact."
 artifact_hunt.0002.t:89 "Hired Help"
 artifact_hunt.0003.a:89 "We ride!"
 artifact_hunt.0003.b:89 "I have other battles to win."
 artifact_hunt.0003.desc:89 "Any good leader must be willing to get his hands dirty in the pursuit of glory and power, or so the storytellers have told us. Today, I will lead a ranging of my personal retinue to search for the supposedly nearby artifact. The party will be broken up into pairs and sent to canvass as wide an area as is possible. Hopefully the excursion will prove to be a swift one, and without any interference from man, beast, or darker entity. The hunt has not been outfitted for heavy combat, and our main advantage will be out speed. With any luck I shall return home by tomorrow at the latest, my new artifact by my side."
 artifact_hunt.0003.t:89 "The Ranging"
 artifact_hunt.0004.a:89 "Time to dash off an invitation."
 artifact_hunt.0004.b:89 "Perhaps I should save my gold for a more certain endeavor."
 artifact_hunt.0004.desc:89 "Apparently the artifact I've been looking for has actually found its way into the hands of a minor neighboring noble. They might not be so willing to just part with it, even for a good sum of coin. Of course, seeing as how I am the dominant lord in this region, I could exert my power as well as my own personal charm in order to get them to budge. Should that prove not enough, I could go a step further and resort to threats and cajoling. I just hope they'll listen to reason before it comes to anything so brutish."
 artifact_hunt.0004.t:89 "Cutting A Deal"
 artifact_hunt.0005.a:89 "Now which scroll was it?"
 artifact_hunt.0005.b:89 "On second thought, this will likely be a pointless endeavor."
 artifact_hunt.0005.desc:89 "Searching around aimlessly might be well and good for the common folk, but I am above such wastes of time! I've found bits and pieces of information regarding the artifact rumored to be nearby. By analyzing the clues left behind in these ancient tomes and scrolls, I can significantly narrow down the possible resting place of my target, making the most difficult part of this task all the simpler. Once I have decoded the location, I can simply dispatch some scholars with skills in archeology to secure my new prize."
 artifact_hunt.0005.t:89 "Hitting The Scrolls"
 artifact_hunt.0006.a:89 "Get me an abacus."
 artifact_hunt.0006.b:89 "Maybe a shall wait for a rainy day to crack this mystery."
 artifact_hunt.0006.desc:89 "My steward has brought me word of a most fortunate development in my search for the artifact! It seems that local records may hold the key to retrieving my target. Of course, many of these documents are quite dense and will require careful reading and cross-referencing if I am to secure an understanding of them. My steward has pledged to help me discern some of the possible ciphers and codes he believes were hidden away in these records. Still, given how hard someone has worked to keep this treasure hidden, I cannot be certain we will be able to find success."
 artifact_hunt.0006.t:89 "A Bureaucratic Break"
 artifact_hunt.0007.a:89 "Perhaps this was fate..."
 artifact_hunt.0007.b:89 "Maybe some things are best left alone..."
 artifact_hunt.0007.desc:89 "As I finish my hunt, the success of it bringing me great joy, a certain strange feeling overtakes me. It is not an unpleasant feeling, rather being like a warm compulsion, pulling me towards something unknown. I turn from my path and walk towards the mysterious and unfamiliar force drawing me somewhere else. Inevitably, I reach the place it was trying to bring me, finding a certain object where the pull is strongest, at which point the feeling vanishes."
 artifact_hunt.0007.t:89 "Benevolent Compulsion"
 artifact_hunt.0008.a:89 "What a shame."
 artifact_hunt.0008.desc:89 "Despite my best efforts, the search for what could have been a legendary artifact has turned up naught. Whether it was from my own failings or the others I enlisted, the trail has gone cold."
 artifact_hunt.0008.t:89 "No Luck"

 artifact_aversarianspear_desc:89 "#size:15 This spear is of Aversarian design and exceptionally well crafted. Most likely a piece forged in the late 12th century, it glimmers with bands of electrum around a polished iron shaft. The head is forged to resemble a blood drop, with a single shining ruby where it meets the base.\n\nSpears like this were common in the Aversarian legions, though the craftsmanship marks this out as the weapon of a high ranking officer or noble."

 artifact_banner_wardenism_description:89 "Though there is no evidence to suggest that the [Concept('the_first_warden','First Warden')|E] only used one battle standard throughout the entirety of his life as often claimed, this banner is certainly the most famous — it was present at the landmark Battle of the Burning Key, which saw the decisive defeat of the Sarradonian Regent Ulathir by [Concept('wardenism','Wardenite')|E] forces and the beginning of a thousand-year long dominance in the Sinhamiyah valley.\n\nDespite catching fire mid-battle and being the target of numerous enemy attempts of destruction, it would largely survive intact (likely due to the specific type of fabric used in its make, rather than a miracle as sometimes claimed) and serve as the rallying point for the outnumbered [Concept('wardenism','Wardenite')|E] forces, and would subsequently give the battle its name."
