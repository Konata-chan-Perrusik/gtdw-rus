## On Womanly Knights ##
 feature_book_title_womanknights:89 "On Womanly Knights"
 feature_book_topic_womanknights:89 "This book was written by Chevalien scholar Michon Andreaux sometime in the 11th century to compile numerous smaller works by various authors of his time which argued for or against the concept of a woman being bestowed the title of knight, most likely due to the dubbing of the female Anti-Magi Rose den va Kreysauns at the beginning of the century by the warlord King Anton Descradau.\n\nWhile there are many examples in Marcher history of women warriors, the specific title of knighthood is one that has nearly never been given to a woman. While the works are generally in support of women fighting and none dare try and blemish the name of the many Marcher heroes of the fairer sex, Andreaux ends the work by claiming that female knight's are themselves an attack against the 'strong and noble traditions' that the title holds, despite a begrudging admittance that Lady Rose's slaying of nearly a hundred undead and an [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] Magi before her 19th winter were somewhat impressive."

## Raleri: The Boqqar of Knives ##
 feature_book_title_boqqarofknives:89 "Raleri: The Boqqar of Knives"
 feature_book_topic_boqqarofknives:89 "First published in 853 IS, The Boqqar of Knives is a biography of one of the [boqqarut_damotada|E]'s most famed, and feared, rulers. The book covers the entirety of his publicly-known life, from his childhood in the Tabik Bētemisīt, to his sudden and unexpected ascendance to the throne, to the following decades of intrigue and secrecy, concluding with his death in 817 IS. More famously, however, is the books focus on unconfirmable theories and speculation about the unknowns of his life, addressing and even inventing rumors of his countless secret plots and many murders, stringing together the untimely demises of his rivals, and painting an incredibly believable picture of a shadowy puppetmaster pulling Damota on his strings.\n\nWhen published, the book was endorsed by Boqqar Kayoba, who sought to use its unflattering portrayal of his much-hated grandfather to distance himself from his shadow. Often considered the last great work of the [Concept('boqqarut_damotada','Boqqarut')|E], the tale told of Raleri within its pages is the narrative which history has chosen to believe."

## Adabyssian Report on Northern Civilization ##
 feature_book_title_adabyssianreport:89 "Adabyssian Report on Northern Civilization"
 feature_book_topic_adabyssianreport:89 "This carefully sealed scroll contains a long-form report from what appears to have been Adabyssian spies sent north to study the north and its people's in preparation for eventual invasion. With references to reports going back some 300 years before [frodbrokna|E], the report generally concludes with agreement that the denizens of [sarradon|E] and [aversaria|E] are most likely a distant cousin to humanity, and have more in common with humanlike animals than they do civilized species."

## From Aeladaxos to Aeliadias ##
 feature_book_title_aeladaxostoaeliadias:89 "From Aeladaxos to Aeliadias"
 feature_book_topic_aeladaxostoaeliadias:89 "This book is a widely printed publication detailing the life of Aautokratia Aeliadias who ruled during the 6th century. While the book covers most of her hundred plus years of rule, her victory over the [Concept('dragons','Dragon')|E] [arthenax|E], her massive magical powers and the massive rebuilding of [aversaria|E] she performed, over half of it is focused upon her famous origins. Primarily, it discusses the rather controversial point of her life, wherein she was born as Aeladaxos, but disliking her station as a male used powerful magics to embrace womanhood.\n\nThe author, one [magi|E] Kalathros, spends much of his time criticizing the detractors of the concept. Kalathros points out that Aeliadias was an Aversarian Magi and performed her transformation completely of her own power and volition, and argues that it should instead be celebrated as a true feat of magic and self-expression."

Second, that Naramaššin's invasion was completely unjustified, as disproven by the countless records of Orasbaeli, Valthronax, and Tylonic provocations in the years leading up to the conflict. Finally, the assertion that the Arakkariac realm was left shattered and in retreat after the Battle of Paelon Hill, instead painting it as an important, but ultimately relatively small clash that merely proved the unprofitability of continued conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the work posits that the conquest would likely have been successful regardless, had the empire not disintegrated in a bloody civil war after its monarch died in the same year as the battle."

Of course, this picture is in stark contrast with anything even unbiased scholars would say about the living conditions of the Imperium, leading many to dismiss the book as nothing but a propaganda piece written by Climent to ingratiate himself with his patron.\n\nOf much greater interest to the common reader, however, are the rather fascinating pages that talk about the city itself - an impressive metropole of marble and brass, with clockwork automata seemingly integrated into every facet of life. The credibility of these parts of the book have never been in question, for the Kartharaddi were widely known for their mastery of clockwork machinery.\n\nCuriously, though it would seem that the work originally referenced the name of the city several times, it is actually impossible to read these specific words.

From their foundation in 572 IS under Boqqar Datesh of the [olani_dynasty|E], to their subsequent role in the Second [tetenik|E], Mekha explores their initial functions and procedures, and how exactly they first became embroiled in politics on both the local and regional scale.

The author points out how only Aversarians are human, and only Magi truly human, and that all humans of the Aautokratia have the highest standard of life and amount of rights in the known world.

It paints a vivid picture of mysterious cults roaming the wastes, abducting the innocent for use in mysterious and sinister rituals to serve dark purposes. It tells of Lexenir's encounters with no less than 11 different cults, each of which possessed their own strange and violent traditions. These traditions, which range from ritual cannibalism to human sacrifice to drinking the blood of Redrunner settlers, are described in excruciating detail, as is his heroism in saving people from such terrible fates. The people of the Redlands are described in ways that make them sound less than human, claiming that they hide themselves during the day due to the sun's deadly light. \n\nThe book is accompanied by a series of drawings, which Lexanir claims are traditional Redlander art, consisting of complicated patterns of shapes, arranged so that they seem to suggest great monsters in their curving, spiraling lines. The book was received with mixed acclaim, and many have claimed that Lexenir, and his story, are both fabrications. Nonetheless it provides those who live across the far-flung Empire a taste of the mysterious Redlands."

Procopion's main arguments against the existence of the Fog are the unreliability of tribal witnesses, the intristic absurdity of a magical phenomenon not apparently associated with either the Living or Dead schools, the ability to ascribe many of the strange events sighted to more mundane reasons, and Iolianos' alleged Axiaotheaist sympathies. The idea of allowing barbarian tribes to migrate into Aversaria proper is treated with special mockery.\n\nNeedless to say, the work did not age well, and the [GetTitleByKey('e_mayikprolollan').GetNameNoTier] has quietly disowned it and Master Procopion a few decades after its publication."

 feature_book_topic_manswelbestiarium:89 "Ragambald Manswel was a remarkably well traveled Marcher adventurer who purportedly sailed as far east as the borders of Kathun Kai. Upon his return to [chevalie|E] Ragambald began the laborious process of scribing his numerous journals and sketches into written form. The accounts contained within are an unparalelled and surprisingly accurate guide to the various fauna, magical and otherwise, which stalk the remote regions of [aeras|E]. Ragambald's own biography - supposedly recorded in a separate volume - has sadly been almost completely lost to history, but from his surviving work he must have been a remarkable and well educated man. Some have even suggested that Manswel may have been a pen name but this, as with everything else about Manswel's life is heavily disputed among Chevalien literati."
