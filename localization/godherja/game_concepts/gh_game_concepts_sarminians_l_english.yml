 game_concept_domains_of_nalma:90 "Domains of Nalma"
 game_concept_domains_of_nalma_desc:90 "In Leki mythology, Nalma is traditionally understood as being composed of three distinct divine domains: [Glossary('Uranlash','GH_URANLASH_GLOSS')], [Glossary('Damalma','GH_DAMALMA_GLOSS')], and #font:RedactedScriptFont [Glossary('Talza','GH_TALZA_GLOSS')]#!, with the entire living world said to be divided among the then: All that lives below or close to the ground, as well as underwater, belongs to Uranlash, a realm beyond human reach; while everything that walks on solid earth, whether animal or human, lies within the domain of Damalma, the most material of the worlds.\n\nThe last domain is that of #font:RedactedScriptFont Talza, encompassing both the#! first sky and those above #font:RedactedScriptFont it. The singing glories of the suns are so intense there that only trained#! priestesses #font:RedactedScriptFont are said to be able to withstand their radiance, laying down their#! severed braids #font:RedactedScriptFont on altars as a ritual#! sacrifice #font:RedactedScriptFont to commune with the great spirits of the heavens.#!"

 game_concept_anohelis_outcasts:90 "Anohêlis Outcasts"
 game_concept_anohelis_outcasts_desc:90 "The [Glossary('Anohêlis','GH_ANOHELIS_GLOSS')] are a caste of exiles and criminals whose status as freewomen or [Glossary('Órzopajas','GH_ORZOPAJA_GLOSS')] has been stripped from them for severe crimes, treason, betrayal, or cowardice. As punishment, their heads are shaven clean and scalps seared with branding irons so that no hair can grow for decades or more, and very poorly thereafter. Stigmatized and banished from their communities, they are forbidden from returning under the threat of execution — although for many, it is already a fate worse than death."
