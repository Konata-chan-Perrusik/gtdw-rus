 game_concept_mothers_and_fathers_desc:0 "In Clanlander customs, the 'Mothers and Fathers' refers to the collective rituals and practices of the Clanlander tribes that have survived through the ages as memory and history of their past. These stories are collected, generally in song form, and are meant to be carried by each generation onto the next to protect both their legacy and the Cycle of the Wood— a belief that the migrations of the great forests and its creatures are vital to the continued existence of Humanity. All that lives will die and be reborn, and the forests are one piece of keeping the cycle flowing. People must do what they can to aid the wood, and many will take a wide variety of stances on what must be done, from songs to distinct dietary and construction restrictions."
