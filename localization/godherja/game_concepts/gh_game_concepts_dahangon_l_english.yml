  game_concept_nari_daya_desc:89 "The legendary warrior-queen of the Dayarka, Daya was the eldest daughter of [naklan_the_golden|E], and served as one of his chief advisors during his conquest of Dahangon. An ambitious and capable warrior, the princess contested her nephew’s ascension to the throne after the death of Naklan, naming herself Nari, or Queen, and plunging Dahangon into civil war.\n\nDespite her prowess, however, Nari Daya was unable to take the throne, as most of her father’s vassals rallied against her for breaking tradition. Wary of losing to a battle of attrition, she instead carved up a realm in the Kharadan mountains, where she established a matriarchal society alongside her most fervent followers."

  game_concept_ratarakaw:89 "Ratarakaw"
  game_concept_ratarakaw_desc:90 "Occurring in the middle of the thirteenth century IS, the Ratarakaw is a catastrophe considered in Dahangon to be second only in severity to the [Concept('frodbrokna','Dusapyas')|E]. The disaster began with a sudden shattering of the noontide sky, revealing a lightless void from which a titanic structure fell hurtling towards the southeastern Kharadan mountains. The impact not only flattened the mountain it struck, but also caused severe quakes that tore apart the ancient citadel of Dawang Tarmak.\n\n The calamity also brought an end to the nearly successful uprising of Nalaykan, after the great chieftain was buried beneath the rubble of his own fortress, granting a much-needed reprieve to the beleaguered Kathuni of the Bronzeport."
