 game_concept_doradalem:0 "Doradalem"
 game_concept_doradalem_desc:0 "The ancestral homeland of the Mondecny people, Doradalem was almost a perfect match for the Mondecny culture's traditional isolationism, cradled as it was between towering mountains and surrounded by a forest wall so dense that it is completely impassable at most points. These factors meant that the Mondecny were rarely seen by their neighbors, and the mysterious land beyond the forest wall was often feared as a mythical place of wonders and magic by those who lived outside it. Inside the wall, the Mondecny lived in scattered towns and hamlets, pursuing a rustic, even primitive lifestyle sustained by the almost unmatched fertility of the land upon which they dwelled. Their metallurgic skills never surpassed the knowledge to smelt copper, largely due to the lack of any significant internal warfare (The Dethedklan Kin-struggle being the one major exception) or invasion from the outside world at any point in Mondecny recorded history. To hear them tell it, in Doradalem their lifestyle had not changed a bit since the day the gods created [aeras|E] - a claim which, astoundingly, might even have been true."

 game_concept_cnevobarthane_desc:0 "The peculiar god of the Theugombrians, Cnevobarthane is a solar deity usually depicted as a young man crowned with a brilliant halo and wielding a golden spear. It is believed by his worshippers that he is periodically reincarnated among them as an infant. The reborn God is unrecognizable at first, only regaining his memories and deific potency at puberty. Though there have been a few pretenders to this title throughout history proving the rebirth as genuine requires demonstrating powers beyond the ken of all but the most exceptional of Magi. Nevertheless, a the Speakers supposedly claim a list of nearly sixty canonical reincarnations going back over ten thousand years.\n\nWhile it is unclear just how much of that historical record is true, it has been noted that at least two of the three most recent Cnevobarthanes do seem to coincide with some of the most ancient legends of the people of the Continental Interior. These sparse handfuls of fragmentary written sagas and mutated oral legends speak of the rise of a successive pair of incredibly powerful Magi who were worshipped as gods a little over a millennia and a half before the rise of [aversaria|E]."

 game_concept_theugombrians:0 "Theugombrians"
 game_concept_theugombrians_desc:0 "The Theugombrians have no homeland. They have wandered the Continental interior since time out of memory, occasionally setting down roots on small patches of wasteland to farm or herd in heavily fortified communities, but more often roaming in great caravans, setting down fortified camps for a few weeks or months at most. Their culture stresses both discipline and martial training for youths of both sexes and they are often referred to by chroniclers and poets as an army without a country. Indeed they often sell their services as mercenaries or auxiliaries to anyone who will pay. Their culture seems to hold little guard for distinctions between sexes, placing equal responsibilities upon both men and women both within the Theugombrian household and while under arms. Additionally, It is not uncommon for Theugombrian women to take multiple husbands, sometimes up to three, though the reverse among Theugombrian men is exceedingly rare.\n\nTheir nature as permanent outsiders and nomads has made the Theugombrians the frequent victims of suspicion and distrust by their settled neighbors, an attitude they are more than willing to reciprocate if needed. While they have occasionally been the victims of mob violence, the heavily armed and militarized nature of their society means that this often ends badly for their aggressors, and most towns with a tendency towards xenophobic paranoia have learned to swallow their prejudices and leave them well enough alone in their fortified camps.\n\nTheir tightly knit kin-groups are based around matrilineal lineages which can in some families be reliably traced back over fifty generations. Indeed, a few of the oldest histories written by the societies of the Continental Interior mention a people clearly recognizable as Theugombrians, implying that they have held onto a discernable cultural identity far older than almost any people still extant on [aeras|E] today.\n\nThe Theugombrians do not, as a rule, recognize slavery. Captives taken in war are either sold back at random, executed if they have attracted some particular ire from their captors, or adopted into the clan itself if the prisoner proves themself willing and useful. In this manner Theugombrian clans can often develop quite a mixed ethnic appearance, with Kathuni, Sarradonian, and even Damotan ancestry not unheard of within individual families."

 game_concept_magiskrit_desc:0 "First encountered by the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E] in the esoteric glyphs left by the Azarg Kutahnu͞ug in the [aehan_massacre|E], 'Magiskrit' is a collective term used to refer to a series of poorly understood words where magic is somehow carried on the written inscriptions. While most of the discovered words only convey varying levels of discomfort ranging from mild nausea to acute hemophobia, seven words were discovered to effectively be booby traps, causing the horrific deaths of several [mayikrata|E] under-studies."

 game_concept_azarg_kutahnuug_translation_debate_desc:0 "The very name 'Azarg Kutahnu͞ug' was found inscribed in enormous blood-red glowing glyphs written on the mutilated body of [Concept('aehan_massacre','Aeha')|E] herself. Despite years of studying the deciphered text, rediscovered Kartharaddi reports, rumors, and missives received from the ill-fated Theyssian expeditions, [magi|E]-Linguists of the [mayikprolollans|E] debate until the current day that the name either translated to 'Laughing-Dancers-above-the-Flickering-Flames' or 'Fire' depending on whether glyph 353 of the Aeha-murder poems was a distinct word with a diacritic or the same as 902 but slightly misshapen from dripping blood."

 game_concept_azarg_kutahnuug_blood_rituals_desc:0 "Translations of the [Concept('aehan_massacre','Aehan Murder Poems')|E] depict the Azarg Kutahnu͞ug as an extremely militaristic society that subject their people to various grueling rituals. Children are said to be taken at birth from women who are expected to sire continuously until death or sacrifice, and are then immediately inducted into a training regime both parts incredibly strenuous and needlessly cruel. Strange rituals and tests upon the new-borns are normally done to decide whether or not they are worthy of the 'Devil-Tongue-Mercies' (or 'Hat', the first a likely name for the rituals to become a tribesmen in their societies, the second a possible but unlikely result of glyph 1012 being misspelled).\n\nNewborns who 'fail' these tests are normally killed or abandoned (with another set of rituals and prophecies for children who then still return to the tribe as men, despite having been abandoned before even reaching their first year — of which the Azarg Kuthanu͞ug have recorded seven). Those who pass almost all die from the next twenty years of warrior training. Those who do become '[death_seekers|E]' (no alternative translation)."

 game_concept_death_seekers:0 "Death-Seekers"
 game_concept_death_seekers_desc:0 "One of the few phrases whose glyphs' exact translation was universally agreed upon by [magi|E]-Linguists of the [mayikprolollans|E], the Death-Seekers are a group of warriors that have been shockingly been discovered to have actually been in some interaction with [aversaria|E] and possibly even as far as [sarradon|E] for — depending on how many accounts are truly of them and how many are simply of coincidentally similar description — possibly as far back as the pre-Aautokrata era of Aversarian history.\n\nThese warriors, often clad in intricately carved red armor and carrying long spiked blades nearly their own height, travel the world and seemingly murder and slaughter random individuals or groups at the order of the strange 'Spawn' who they claim to worship, and its thousand devil-servants. These rituals normally involve the warrior mixing a pool of both their own blood and a stranger, writing several as-of-yet unknown words in [magiskrit|E], and then drinking the remaining concoction. The apparent connection is apparently exceptionally painful and thankfully brief, with the warrior being shown the location and appearance of who they are to kill next.\n\nEventually, the ritual will kill the warrior, or it will command them to return home, where they then take a myriad of positions for the functioning of the inner tribe. For unknown reasons, some of these wandering warriors have been also recorded in various historical records as having served as mercenaries in various armies — the side seemingly random, and with no coin ever accepted for their work."

 game_concept_bloodmark_incidents:0 "Bloodmark Incidents"
 game_concept_bloodmark_incidents_desc:0 "The Bloodmark Incidents refer to a series of kidnappings and disappearances that were reported both by the Anti-Imperrech (during their [Concept('sjalvolki_migration','march southwards')|E]) and by [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] inhabitants of Katraddia and Aironoi (after the Anti-Imperrech's entry into Amaghea). The incidents involve the sudden disappearance of well-regarded and physically-fit warriors — seemingly into thin air — leaving nothing behind but a single blood-red glyph inscribed on their last known location.\n\nSuspicion fell heavily on the mysterious Azarg Kutahnu͞ug, who have already appeared on the periphery of the southward journey roughly one week before [frodbrokna|E] even occurred, and have seemingly become increasingly willing to 'join' (or more accurately, silently follow) refugee groups fleeing south. Accompanying this was the emergence of reports of outsiders being inducted into their strange society seemingly without any care of their foreign status, despite there being very little precedent for Azarg Kutahnu͞ug being seen among or lording over foreigners or likewise being ruled by them."
