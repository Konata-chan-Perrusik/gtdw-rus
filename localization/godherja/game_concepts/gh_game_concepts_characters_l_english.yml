 game_concept_aeschraes_desc: "#BOL Aeschraes Aercargiad#! was born during [odrstund|E|l] to the Etepezean sub-governor Epistonicon and the prestigious Aercargiad dynasty. When Aeschraes was 13, Epistonicon, an abusive and sadistic drunk, killed Aeschraes' younger sister (and closest confidant) Arias in one of his tirades. In retaliatory fury, Aeschraes slew his father and annihilated the palace-city in which his family made their home.\n\nAfter this colossal display of magical power, Aeschraes fled to the [mayikrata|E] where he would be put under the tutelage of Magister Peltra, alongside fellow runaway noblewoman Axiaothea. While the two are said to have been close to each other in this time, they would be driven to a formal rivalry at the encouragement and manipulation of their tutor. At the end of their education, they were ordered to duel to the death. Aeschraes, despite being thoroughly beaten and bloodied by Axiaothea, would be declared victor by technicality of Axiaothea collapsing unconcsious after a [Concept('rathiax_incident', 'catastrophic battle')|E], and threatening the Council of the Mayikprollolan into ending the duel prematurely.\n\nAeschraes, graduated and named Magister of the Mayikprollolan, went on to join and become the Legon of State Legio XXI ‘Anesimasios’, though the popular notion of Axiaothea being the legitmate victor of their duel haunted his reputation. Years would pass, in which Aeschraes' poltical standing would be respectable, but never especially prominent, though he and Axiaothea would once again butt heads through politics after her marriage to Aautokratir Anesimasios. At one of Anesimasios and Axiaothea's marriage banquets, Aeschraes stood in attendance, and held a number of hidden conversations with Axiaothea. The nature of the conversations would never be known, but at the end of the banquet, the infamous [Concept('poisoning_of_anesimasios', 'poisoning of Anesimasios')|E] would take place.\n\nIn a night, Aversarian politics were shaken once more, and the [imperial_civil_war|E] would begin. Aeschraes would earn victory at the sacrifice of his empire, and his new family in his terrible casting of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E]. Aeschraes would rule from Oraispol over his [Concept('ashen_aautokrata_fix', 'Ashen Aautokrata')|E] alongside infamous lieutenants such as [karthyn_delenel|E] and [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E], until 1229 IS when Legan Isacea led [the_vilnian_assault|E|l] in which he was overthrown and [Concept('the_oration_of_legions', 'pronounced dead')|E] to the [Concept('the_continent', 'Shattered Coast')|E]. This was an exaggeration, though with the destruction of the [theyssian_scrivenery_network|E] brought on by Arch-Magi Terrox, Aeschraes' empire would crumble in the [six_great_revolts|E]."
