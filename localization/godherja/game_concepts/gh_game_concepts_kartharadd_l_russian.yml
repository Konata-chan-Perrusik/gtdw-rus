 game_concept_night_of_the_bleeding_moon_desc:0 "One of the most infamous episodes of the entire [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], the Night of the Bleeding Moon refers to the cataclysm that engulfed the entirety of the [Concept('kartharadd','Kartharaddi Imperium')|E] in the dark hours of the 23rd of Velde, 748. The name itself comes from the fact that [aervalr|E], as well as the entire night sky across the world shone a brilliant, deep crimson for the duration of the catastrophe. Any that were sleeping were immediately awoken, and as the event reached its fever pitch, the low screams of an entire empire in its death throes could be heard on the horizon regardless of location.\n\nThe disaster left around 80% of the Imperium's population dead, virtually all of its major population centers reduced to rubble, and the Kartharaddi capital was consumed in a vortex of hellfire that still hangs over the area to this day. [Concept('the_continent','Greater Aversaria')|E], once sprawling, cosmopolitan and urban, was effectively reset to a wild wasteland, but the effects reached as far as Malcois, which was left heavily hit and depopulated.\n\nThe causes and responsible parties remain an unresolved question to this day. Though the aautokrata was quick to deny involvement due to the bad optics involved in claiming responsibility for an event that so devastated Malcois (a fact often forgotten nowadays), successive aautokratirs have constantly switched the official imperial stance on Oraispol's level of involvement, mostly depending on what option is currently the most politically expedient."

 game_concept_kartharadd_desc:0 "Glorious Kartharadd, once the greatest rival civilization the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E] had ever met, is nowadays nothing but broken ruins strewn across the vast expanse of [Concept('the_continent','Greater Aversaria')|E].\n\nProficient [living_magi|E] and masters of clockwork technology, the Kartharaddi built a large, cosmopolitan realm in the continental interior through a series of conquests that spanned from the 2nd century BI to the 8th IS, when they fatefully fought their last against [aversaria|E]. They were ruled by a semi-divine Imperator, who held an iron grip over his domain that few contemporaries could hope to match, in large part thanks to a vast slave-government apparatus that is poorly understood today.\n\nMost information about their history, government and customs was lost in the [night_of_the_bleeding_moon|E], when the entire Imperium was reduced to ashes in the span of a few hours, and what little remained was systemically destroyed by the Aautokrata, who wished to erase any records of their former foe's existence from the face of [aeras|E] itself out of vengeance. The name of no single Imperator has survived to the present date, and the last of their line is especially shrouded in a seemingly impenetrable veil of mystery. Even the name of their capital, now one of the most hellish and hostile wastes in the world, has been seemingly completely stricken from living memory.\n\nThough once their merest mention was a taboo that would elicit feelings of discomfort among Aversarians, in more recent times they've become more of a historical curio for the general public, a topic of interest for those intentionally seeking to stir controversy, and a perennial bane to the conservative."

 game_concept_wo_ashanan_desc:0 "The practice of head-taking by the Kardwen, known to them as “Wo Ashanan” or “Spirit Capture”, is a hallmark of conflict among their people. Believing the soul to reside, conscious, within the skull until it is ceremonially broken, Kardwen often take these as hostage until they can be exchanged at the resolution of peace. Alternatively, the most egregious criminals will have their heads embalmed so that their spirit may never see the release of the afterlife. It is also customary for warriors to wear these trophies as charms, believing them to give extraordinary powers in combat."
