  game_concept_theyssian_scrivenery_network_desc: "The Theyssian Scrivenery Network was an [Concept('aversaria', 'imperial')|E] [Concept('magic', 'magical')|E] ritual system allegedly created - or at least named - by Aautokratia Theyssia and her personal [magi|E]. The Scrivenery Network was initially a series of rituals and technologies that allowed up to a dozen reed pens to mimic the movements of one, allowing a scribe to copy to as many scrolls at a time. By the second half of Theyssia's rule, innovations with bloodcrystal allowed for this process to be done for up to a hundred at a time at some cost, or individually at great ranges. The Network thereafter formed, thousands of interlinked scrolls that could share messages between Magi or be used to send out proclamations from the Throne. At the peak of the Golden Age, even the State Legions had enough Magi, magic and funds to establish dedicated networks within themselves to help send orders or dispatches.\n\nOver time the network became both increasingly difficult to control and even more costly to maintain. Developments in the ritual allowed for even more scrolls to be connected at once or to multiple different locations at a time, but focuses largely moved elsewhere, and few golden age Magi bothered to find ways to reduce the ever-mounting maintenance costs. By the late Empire, it was completely choked with endless arguments between various Magi and factions, debates over the state of the Empire, vitriol, and streams of pure nonsense or madness. At its worst, it had begun to host memetic viruses - curses and hexes sent from one Magi to another that had by some forgotten connection to other scrolls, accident or malicious intent spread across much larger parts of the Scrivenery Network. The death of the Magi Theysar and a dozen servants who had discovered his body in 1121 IS to a 'forbidden word' that had been copied to his scrolls led to widespread panic across the nobility, and much of the Network was intentionally shut down thereafter. After [odrstund|E|l] most of the remaining Network was so bizarrely hateful that it was generally regarded as effectively unreadable and sometimes staggeringly dangerous.\n\nThe Network would finally meet its end in 1230 IS in the wake of [the_vilnian_assault|E|l] with [Glossary('Terroxs Declarations','GH_TERROXS_DECLARATIONS_GLOSS')], when the last remaining major Scriptoriums that could print scrolls at scale in the [mayikrata|E] were worked into destruction printing thousands of copies to be sent across the former Empire, and the efforts to print the massive declaration burnt out most remaining magic in the Network where it did remain. By then it had already been damaged horribly in [frodbrokna|E] and the once-stable magics of the ritual that powered the devices had become erratic and dangerous, and the knowledge of how to recreate the rituals that powered it would be considered lost even before [sjalvolki_migration|E|l]."

  game_concept_aversarian_slavery: "Aversarian Slavery"
  game_concept_aversarian_slavery_desc: "The [Concept('aversaria', 'Aversarinas Aautokrata')|E] was infamous for its massive, brutal systems of slavery which a majority of the Aautokrata's population in the later stages of the empire were bound beneath. While the types of slavery varied just as much as everything else in Aeras's once-most populated Empire, Aversarian society legally specified two types of slavery:\n\n• Slavery of the Body - A slave labors as a slave, and may be doing so to pay off a debt, purchase their own freedom, or as property to a non-slave.\n• Slavery of the Blood - A slave is born and lives a slave, and may be a member of a culture or faith consigned to mass slavery, or live as a member of a Slave Caste.\n\nSlaves could be members of both groups - and those born within Aversaria's borders and society almost always were. Those who are Slaves of the Body but not the Blood can live free lives once their circumstances (whatever they may be) change, and their children will be born free. Slaves of the Blood however were considered slaves by birth or being instead of circumstance, and constituted slave dynasties, slave villages and communes, and even slave kingdoms beneath the Empire. While Slavery of the Blood bound one permanently to their oppressors, some slave castes were richer and more well respected than some lower class Citizen and non-Citizen castes.\n\nCitizenship in Aversaria is considered proof of one's Humanity, and citizens could never be enslaved in Body or Blood by Imperial Law. Thus by Imperial rhetoric, all slaves in the Empire - even those owning lands and belonging to respected lineages passing centuries of cultures and faiths indistinguishable from their Citizen neighbors - are non-human. The status and rights of the slaves, and slavery's status as a core insitution of the Empire, has long been a source of contention."

The callous became sociopathic, the cruel became bloodthirsty, the spiteful turned to hateful. The results (besides several serial murders) were not immediate, but quickly became apparent within a decade. With the Magi more destructive than ever, Aversaria began witnessing a rapid escalation in the number and scales of civil wars and internal conflict, with ten times the number of nobility being assassinated in 1178 than the entire decade preceding the Odrstund.\n\nAeschraes, leader of the Oraispol Aautokrata in the [imperial_civil_war|E], was born on the Odrstund.

While one of thousands of civil wars in the Aversarianas Aautokrata over the years since its inception, the Imperial Civil War earned distinction for being the one that ended the Aversarinas Aautokrata and brought forth the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E] with Aeschraes (one of the pretenders in the War) causing [frodbrokna|E].\n\nThe war began after the mysterious death of Aautokratir Anesimasios, and the accusation that his wife, Axiaothea, poisoned him. In the [blood_senate|E] following his death, Axiaothea destroyed the entire gathering and the assorted nobility with the few survivors quickly bending the knee to her. On her return to the cultural capital of Oraispol, however, a coup was launched by Legon Aeschraes and Legio XXI 'Aeschraes' (now 'Axiaothea'), who proclaimed her a false aautokratia and declared himself the rightful ruler.\n\nThe proceeding war lasted almost twenty years, leaving most of the Empire wartorn as nobility constantly shifted sides or broke off to form their own factions. The war was most notable for the increasingly extreme power of [magic|E] brought on by the rapid research and development of previously unused or underdeveloped spells. Entire cities were wiped out in massive magical blasts, southern Opakhasia was turn into a burnt out wasteland, and the war ended with a spell so large it brought forth Frodbrokna. While Axiaothea was killed in this spell, so was the Empire, and Aeschraes' own realm rapidly collapsed in the following years despite his 'victory'."

  game_concept_the_vilnian_assault_desc: "The Vilnian Assault was a battle taking place after the [imperial_civil_war|E] in the city of Oraispol, late in 1229 IS between the forces of Aautokratir Aeschraes of the reigning 'Oraispol Aautokrata' and Legan Isacea and her Legio XXI 'Axiaothea'.\n\nAs Aeschraes struggled to maintain his failing grip on [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E]—Aironoi in complete rebellion and the rest of the Empire drifting to anarchy — Legio XXI struggled to survive in Opakhasia. Having formerly been Aeschraes' personal legion (then titled 'Aeschraes'), they were brutally hunted throughout much of Aversaria by the Aautokratir's lieuenant [karthyn_delenel|E].\n\nIsacea resolved to end Aeschraes' rule, claiming the legion and Aversaria both would not be safe until the 'wicked Aautokratir' had been either killed or imprisoned, and resolved for the Legion to gather what allies it could and assault the capital.\n\nTogether with a Noble Legion gifted by by Despexir Hexon of Dymetra, a force of former-legionary's turned mercenary, and forces belonging to criminal organizations in western Etepezea standing in opposition to the underground network controlled by [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E], Isacea commenced her assault.\n\nThe attack was named for the Vilnian Gate (after Aautokratir Vilnian) around which the attack began. Disguised as merchants entering the city to trade from the northern village of Ilthia, Isacea and an elite force of forty men snuck through the gate and killed its guards, opening it to her force. Some thousand men either entered the city through the gate or threw off disguises they had been wearing across the city, and soon fought their way towards the Imperial Palace at Aexionarax's Hill.\n\nReaching the throne despite heavy losses, Isacea and her remaining forces confronted Aautokratir Aeschraes before Maklea's dais, who ordered Iron-Spike and Delenel to slay her. The events thereafter are unclear, but the assault would end in failure. Iron-Spike and Delenel, along with the rest of Aeschraes' top guards, [magi|E], and his inner circle were slain in the battle (Iron-Spike and Delenel in single combat with Isacea). However, Aeschraes managed to kill the wounded Legan, and Legio XXI and its allies were fought back and out of the city with heavy casualties.\n\nDespite Isacea's failure, the assault would nonetheless be partially successful. The Oraispol Aautokrata was killed in the assault, with Aeschraes' entire inner circle who held the tenuous construction together slain and the prestige of the Aautokratir ruined, order outside of Etepezea utterly collapsed. Without allies and his rule collapsing, the Governor of Etepezea (Lycus Xenepheron) performed a coup against Aeschraes and usurped control of Western Etepezea, ending the rule of the Aautokratir."

While the war began with Methiad's guerilla war against [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E], the conflict is most known for the arrival of Governor Arch-Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' in 1247 IS. Nicanoneus would work for both Methiad and Gurdurbok during the conflict, notably in his assault on the Methiad-aligned fortress of Tarwek and the assassination of Gurdurbok loyalist Eldradd 'Bane-Star' Pithicladd.\n\nNicanoneus would later be given soldiers by both sides to battle the incoming [Concept('sjalvolki_migration','Sjalvolki')|E] where he'd become the first [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] to defeat Cenware Witch-Breaker in the Battle of Bergkoga, but would fall back north after failures to secure his victory. Nicanoneus blamed both sides for this, and turned on his erstwhile 'allies', starting with the assassination of Gurdurbok in his estates in the Black Mountains. Soon after, he would march west to deal with Governor Dethlycan, who sent assassins and her personal legion to stop his advance. Both would fail, the assassins being caught by Nicanoneus' personal guard and her legion defecting to the invader. Dethlycan was later caught in an attempt to escape west into [chevalie|E] and was executed by Nicanoneus for 'incompetence and betrayal'.\n\nWith the war over, Nicanoneus assumed control of the north, and the Black Mountain War would soon lead into the [ash_war|E]."

Partic [magi|E] wreaked great havoc on Aversarian supply lines, and the combined force soon drove the Aversarian forces back east. The lines eventually settled in eastern Muisle, where trenches and battlements were dug so that Aversarian Magi could throw fire onto the fields while obscuring themselves from Chevalien griffon riders. This period of static warfare was reinforced by the creation of multiple siege castles by both sides.\n\nThe war ended in 1251 IS when the Marcher-Partic alliance commenced an all-out assault against Nicanoneus' forces, timing their assault alongside a raid by the [Concept('liches','Lich')|E] Ilnar Illadir. Nicanoneus was maimed by a firebolt from a Partic Magi and during his two-week coma, his forces were routed back east into the Black Mountains, where he would reorganize his men and realm into Epavarion - the Ebony League.

The beginning of the war is considered to be the massive series of raids perpetrated by the E'hat'm queen Iezatha of the Baotaadar against Imperial shipping in 963 IS, in flagrant violation of the various treaties that had been signed with the E'hat'mic rulers of the southern archipelago. In response to these provocations, Aautokratia Alcandrea proclaimed that the E'hat'm, as had been displayed, were impossible to negotiate with, and began laying plans for an invasion of unimaginable scale and scope, to begin as soon as the fleet was assembled. Lacking any formal navy, however, the Aautokratia chose to send out a proclamation across the Aautokrata, promising land in Krehejad to any who joined the fleet, and great rewards to the first to set foot upon the island. This offer was seen as incredibly appealing by the impoverished Islanders, and soon the various mooring points were filled to the brim with enthuisiastic crews, rubbing shoulders with a massive collection of State Legions, all preparing for the operation. In addition, they were joined by a sizable contingent of slaves, offered freedom and the right to settle on the islands should they serve with distinction.\n\nCome the spring of 966 IS, the fleet embarked, and though the voyage itself was not without incident — with several Islander captains taking the opportunity to assail their rivals — the chaos which the invasion would come to be known for by its veterans truly began when flags belonging to the E'hat'm were spotted ahead. Behind them, however, was land, which prompted a mad rush by several vessels to be the first to claim their promised reward. The battle itself, immortalized as the [battle_of_the_imperial_sea|E], ended in victory for the Empire, and though the war would continue for the next several years, by 967 IS the land grants were doled out to those who had earned them, and the Archexate of Krehejad was born, a client kingdom subservient to the Empire."

The battle has a well-earned reputation for chaos, as both sides lacked rigid command structures, with individuals Legons and captains having near-complete control of their ships. As a result, once battle was joined, formation broke apart completely as each vessel chose its own individual targets, while Imperial and E'hat'mic [magi|E] decimated entire flotillas.\n\nSoon, the chaos spilled onto the land, as Islander vessels and ambitious Legons rushed ahead to claim the rewards promised to the first to make landfall, resulting in several instances of friendly fire as Aversarian vessels fought for the honor. In an unexpected twist, however, this chaotic landfall would lend the Empire an advantage, as the E'hat'mic fleets who tried to retreat onto the land often found their ports of origin already occupied. The Battle of the Imperial Sea is considered to have ended when the remnants of Iezatha's fleet chose to flee Krehejad, retreating to the southern colony of Ketruna."

The Krupleg then agreed to sell a limited amount of Shimmerstone as long as the line of Axliades ruled the 'magic tribe'.

Sixteen Legions, mostly natives of Kalathipsomi and local State Legions, marched south from lines across the Pathos River after the defeat of the Varicadd Imperial Clique. Hoping to winter in the nearby homesteads, they instead ended up marching straight into the vanguard of the Witch-Breaker's right flank. After a disastrous series of battles for both sides, the Legions retreated... and did so straight into the center of the Sjalvolki horde.\n\nThe following battle would last for nearly six months, as the Sjalvolki and Imperials brutally fought through the worst winter in Kalathipsomian memory, more soldiers freezing or starving to death than dying in any battle. By the end the Sjalvolki would come out victorious, however, and the shattered remnants of the Legions would disband, join the last remnants of Imperial control under the treacherous Legon Kresox, or retreat south to be wiped out at the Elysian Pass.\n\nWhile overshadowed by the Battle of the Elysian Pass, most scholars agree that the Ten Trees was the last time the Aversarian Legions posed any threat to Cenware's horde, and veterans of the battle often speak bitterly of the 'glory' of the Pass and the forgotten misery of the Ten Trees.

Incompetent leadership under Arch-Legan Kryla Katharitanox along with infighting amongst Aeschraes's senior military leadership (a tactic often employed by Aeschraes, who faced constant paranoia that his leading generals would plan a coup were they not so preoccupied with one another) meant that in their excitement to finally break through they had left almost all lands between the Pass of Mountain-Kings and the fortifications across the straits from Asiupoli almost completely defenseless. Furthermore, Katharitanox had ordered nearly every single auxiliary unit of Battle Magi north with hopes to use them to rapidly overturn any further fortresses along the northern bay.\n\nThis rash march to the north resulted in the creation of openings in the Aeschraeist lines, which were taken advantage of by Axiaothea in the ensuing [western_incursion|E]."

The Ixsians used these gifts to great effect, but new rituals developed after the Ixsians vanished and a swarm of trained wyverns from the Governor of Etepezea's menagerie eventually overcame the defenders. The Ixsians would soon surrender, and much of their great archives were looted, their riches stripped, and the city placed under Imperial authority.

In the following hours, the councillors would all enter bloodthirsty rages in their homes, performing great horrors upon their own houses, ending their own lives thereafter. The remaining Councillors pled for mercy and were given a day to give a tenth of their number as sacrifice, though Maklea would instead imprison and sacrifice the nine for further dark rituals. Her brother, Rethex, would attempt to stop her, and barely survived to flee to the countryside and declare himself Aautokratir in the next year.\n\nThereafter, Maklea would reform the Council and declare that once every four years to thank her for her mercy, one in every ten men on the Council would give their firstborn for sacrifice or service, at her discretion, lest she hex them all as she had their predecessors. The [Glossary('Magisterium of Oraispol','GH_THE_MAGISTERIUM_GLOSS')] would thereafter be built to host the sacrifice, but Maklea would only slay the sacrifices once, each other year granting them mercy in a lifetime of service across the Empire. After her death, the Council did not initially perform the ritual, but upon rioting from the devout and intense pressure from the Maklean Regency Council, they relented and each gave a son to the Imperial Army for the four years until the next sacrifice. By the time of the Kartharaddi Wars, it would be a day for one in every ten men in the city to join one of the Drakarnaxauxila of the Imperial Army to widespread celebration, thereafter returning home and another tenth of the Council's heirs being sent. By then, two thirds of the Council were women due to the wording of Maklea's demands. The word 'Thyaesrix', a proto-Aversarian word roughly equivalent to 'sacrifice', by then had split into multiple. One notable derivative was 'theyssia', a beautiful or honorable sacrice, and a popular woman's name.\n\nBy the reign of the Aautokratia Theyssia, the tradition had become closer to a parade, and had spread to many cities across the Empire - likely as many of those sons of Oraispol were reorganized into the first Imperial Legions during the Kartharaddi Wars and thereafter were granted many lands across the Empire by Aautokratir Eramos. Theyssia would declare it a day of prayer to Maklea and a celebration of her mercy, and the Maklean Pleasure Cults across the empire would begin throwing grand parades for the 'sacrifices' to the Empire in the name of both Theyssia and Maklea thereafter.

In one particularly heated debate with Governor Arch-Legon Karadaxis Aercargiad, he declared:\n\n#inno_quote “You spilled the blood of a thousand Lomonios to lose Kesniathopia, while I spilled the blood of one to save Tinitida.”#!\n\nEramos later acceded to Videro’s requests, declaring the Lomonios a cousin race to the Aversarians and forbidding the indiscriminate sacrifice of Lomonios citizens (though not of Lomonios slaves). Later in life, Videro became a leading figure in the [Glossary( 'Oathbound Revolt', 'GH_OATHBOUND_REVOLT_GLOSS' )]. Though he escaped capture and execution, he was relentlessly hounded by agents of Legio XIII '[Glossary( 'Aautosaxias', 'GH_AAUTOSAXIAS_GLOSS' )]' before finally being cornered and assassinated at the banks of the Kasiryat."

By Imperial law, all Aversarian citizens who show magical ability are required to be allowed to learn in a mayikprolollan, and at the peak of the empire, there were thousands across the empire of various sizes competing for students and prestige. While technically dedicated to magical pursuits, the mayikprolollans often offered full teachings of the sciences, mathematics and history, and even non-Magi citizens and foreigners from outside the empire often received their education through them.\n\nThe most famous and notable mayikprolollans are the [pathosixyic_academies|E] of Kalathipsomi and the [mayikrata|E] chief among them.

Built upon an ancient and unfathomably huge labyrinth that was discovered by Aversarian explorers in the seventh century and of an unknown creation potentially thousands of years prior, the Mayikrata served as both the preeminent school for acolyte Magi and the epicenter for magical study and archival.\n\nWhile untold amounts of Aversaria's developments and discoveries in the arcane arts were thanks to the Mayikrata and its child schools, and it would host and train some of the most legendary and acclaimed Magi in Aversarian history, it would also become one of the most infamous and damaging institutions to the Aautokrata. Due to having unfettered access to the most highly connected youth in Aversaria, the Mayikrata and the rest of the Pathosixyic Academies would often use their position to indoctrinate or even blackmail its students into becoming political puppets. Alongside a wide breadth of less known incidents among instructors abusing their power over their students for other means, the Mayikprolollan would often put students it saw as less important, of less potential worth, or who seemed unlikely to become pawns into excessive danger, using them to experiment with dangerous or unknown rituals or to explore the extremely dangerous depths of the Mayikprolollan itself.\n\nThe Mayikrata would host both Aautokratir Aeschraes and Aautokratia Axiaothea who would go on to lead the [imperial_civil_war|E], the rivalry and future infamy of the two often blamed on the excessively cruel education they received therein. Thereafter as Aversaria collapsed following [frodbrokna|E] and the academies became increasingly isolated, the Pathosixyic Academies would declare independence from the Aversarian realm in 1218 IS with the [month_of_the_magi|E], ending their histories as institutions of learning, political intrigue, and widespread incompetence."

While other mayikprolollans would rise and fall in fame and fortune, the Pathosixyic Academies (the Mayikprolollan sto Spathas, sto Thallas, and chief of all the [mayikrata|E]) would not only be the first three to be formed but also become the informal leaders of all other academies.\n\nAfter their true founding in the eigth century IS, the leaders of the three Academies would convene to write the second edition (and the most important) of the Concordial Pact and, several years later, the Treatise of Good Practice, which would come to dictate the proper and legal teachings of all Aversarian Magi along with the correct usage of magic. Not only schools, the Pathosixyic Academies would also become economic centers and the most important laboratories on [the_continent|E], both building the largest known archive of magical knowledge and artifacts on [aeras|E] and becoming centers for learning and experimentation. Despite this, however, the Pathosixyic Academies would become known for their increasingly political nature. Using their unique position of isolating and controlling the children who would one day be the most influential powerbrokers of Aversaria, the Mayikprolollans often sought to turn their students into political puppets through a mix of social pressure, financial debt, and very often even blackmail and threats.\n\nThe legacy of the Academies as prestigious institutions of learning would end after [frodbrokna|E] and the collapse of the empire during the [month_of_the_magi|E] in 1218 IS, when the Mayikrata would declare itself an independent aautokrata separate from greater Aversaria, followed by similar declarations from its two child academies."

This was its origin however, and a thousand years of formalization and correction to attempt to prevent massive civil wars nearly every generation have led to its modern iteration.\n\nIn the modern world, a Blood Senate is declared just after the time of mourning for the former Aautokratir. The high nobility of the realm choose an agreed upon location and each noble family puts forward one candidate to compete, though other members are allowed to volunteer as well (though this is taboo) and non-nobles are also allowed to join, though this is also taboo.\n\nDuring a Blood Senate, the assorted candidates compete in a bracketed tournament to find who is the most powerful Magi via duels to the death, with no mercy allowed at risk of disqualification.

While Aautokratir Phanagorax is often credited with the conquest of the Iyrossi Valley, most scholars agree that the conquest would not have been possible without Dethediax's skill (especially when compared to the oft debated competence of the Aautokratir).\n\nDethediax was known for her sharp wit and great knowledge of the Iyrossi, born from having been the master of Aversarian forts in northern Opakhasia before the Mytidon Campaign. Dethediax was appointed military governor of the valley after the conquests — often claimed to be the first governor of Malcois despite it not being an official Imperial province until 288 IS — and managed to create a code of laws and regulations that ensured the valley faced no major rebellion after her own death.\n\nWhile contemporaries accused Dethediax of Iyrossi sympathy, especially due to several portions of the law directly challenging the severity of Aversarian rule and circumventing many Imperial laws, it nonetheless managed to fuse old Iyrossi codes with Aversarian law to create a lasting peace between the two groups. Most notably, it used the Iyrossi rules of 'Blood Service' to create a palatable reasoning for the subjugation, and ensured that most Iyrossi would live as 'Autonomous Slaves' in independent communes named 'Iyroikons' which gave them far greater autonomy than most Aversarian slaves.\n\nWhile the Laws would be changed, rescinded, or reinforced multiple times during history (especially with the Theyssian Reforms in 766 IS), they nonetheless remained largely in place until the Iyrossi Rebellions in the 1200s."

While presumably a part a larger statue its scale has meant that none have been able to dive deep enough to glimpse more than its wrist. When [aversaria|E] colonized the region, scholars noted it as a peculiarity, but being unable to identify the make of the vessel it was largely forgotten about for the time.\n\nThis all changed in 1022 IS when a startling observation was made by the scholar Machyos Nottiokos: the vessel clutched within the statue's grasp, once deemed to be of an unrecognizable yet distinctive design by previous scholars, was actually very clearly of contemporary Aversarian design. Leading the first expedition to examine the vessel in centuries, he determined that the heavily rotted wood couldn't have been harvested earlier than the 10th century IS. Indeed, one of the better preserved nails even bore a maker's mark from a blacksmithing guild still active in the Tinitida area.\n\nWhile this mystery would fruitlessly consume the next decade of Machyos' career, it largely remained a local curiosity and his work was ignored until the disappearance of the "Westerly Breeze". The vessel, a state of the art trade ship sporting a novel design, vanished without a trace in the midst of a magical storm in the Southern Isles. Noting that the sketches of the ship bore more than a passing resemblance to his research project, Machyos led a third and final major expedition to the site. There, tearing off a large section of rotted hull and carefully studying the reliefs, they discovered the faintest trace of the words "Westerly Breeze" carved onto it."
