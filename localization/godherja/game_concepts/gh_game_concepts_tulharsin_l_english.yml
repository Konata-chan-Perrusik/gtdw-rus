 game_concept_tulharsin_creation_of_man_desc:0 "In the myths, the creation of man was something of an afterthought to the Gods, who found them incidentally as they rooted through the offal left over from Ke-Ren's explosive act of creation. Finding them too weak to hunt with their bare hands, too hairless to survive the harsh mountain nights, and too frightened of the dark to hide in the caves where they would be safe, it was only through an act of bemused curiosity - and an unspoken feeling of compassion on the part of Mishkush - that the gods chose to educate mankind to ensure their survival."
