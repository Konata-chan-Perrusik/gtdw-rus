 game_concept_khuzaima_al_zuhra:0 "Khuzaima al-Zuhra"
 game_concept_khuzaima_al_zuhra_desc:0 "Khuzaima al-Zuhra was born to the al-Zuhra family, the traditional rulers of Dozzan. A staunch [Concept('ritualism','Ritualist')|E] of the Sophocist sect, he was the leader of the [black_confederation|E] and charged himself with pushing the [Concept('wardenism','Wardenites')|E] east and reclaiming lost Ritualist territory. He has had the distinction of being one of the few truly successful Ritualist warlords, and he has been compared to [usun_bishabelik|E], though among Ritualist circles it is a comparison of what Usun might have been had he not turned into a traitor.\n\nHe is best known for his usage and encouragement of zealous warrior-cults, sponsoring the growth of the Zatani'a in particular, naming the Zatani'a warrior [fihr_ibn_kilab_ibn_zayd|E] prime among his [mubaaizun|E]. While Fihr gained a reputation of being invincible and was worshiped as a demigod, Khuzaima was renowned for his strategic acumen and his eye for talent. His most successful battle was the [battle_of_the_mubaaizun_fix|E], where Fihr managed to slay the opposing Wardenite army's champions and its commander, though in the following combat Khuzaima was thrown off his horse and broke his leg so badly that he walked with a limp thereafter. Enjoying several more victories, he moved to liberate the city of Sulaymaniyan from Wardenite rule and restore it to its Suleimani'a rulers. However, during the [battle_of_sulaymaniyan_fix|E] he was shot in the throat by a Wardenite archer identified as Haziz ibn Qareh.\n\nAfter his death, Fihr died of grief or fell upon his own sword, while Khuzaima's remaining Mubaaizun perished in battle. Khuzaima's son, [abd_hubar_ibn_khuzaima], swore an oath to kill a thousand Wardenites to avenge his father."
 
 game_concept_fihr_ibn_kilab_ibn_zayd:0 "Fihr ibn Kilab ibn Zayd"
 game_concept_fihr_ibn_kilab_ibn_zayd_desc:0 "Fihr ibn Kilab ibn Zayd was a [Concept('ritualism','Ritualist')|E] [mubaaizun|E] born in Rafhamah in 633 IS into the Zatani'a sect. He fought as [khuzaima_al_zuhra|E]'s champion and was prime among his Mubaaizun, being reputedly invincible in battle. According to the official Ritualist histories, Fihr was born to Kilab ibn Zayd, a Zatani'a zealot, though his mother is unknown. He fought alongside Khuzaima al-Zuhra's Ritualist coalition against the [Concept('wardenism','Wardenites')|E] extensively; as Khuzaima's Mubaaizun, he slew countless Wardenite champions in single combat. Before each battle, he supposedly invoked the power of Zatanai and the Djinn to grant him victory and invincibility.\n\nFihr's most victorious battle was the [battle_of_the_mubaaizun_fix|E], where he slew the Wardenite commander and his five Mubaaizun in a row, after each vowed to avenge their commander and fallen comrades. Winning every duel he took part in, Fihr was soon worshiped as a demigod by his fellow Zatani'a, something that Fihr himself began to believe. This demigodhood was formalized by the Malayk al-Mukarridas Zayd al-Thaub, who also officially endorsed his Fihri'a cult. Though he was never defeated in a duel, Fihr died alongside Khuzaima al-Zuhra at the [battle_of_sulaymaniyan_fix|E], when his master was struck with an arrow and perished. Ritualist romanticism has him die of grief, but Wardenite records state that he fell on his own sword. Regardless, he was deified soon after by the Zatani'a as Ilah al-Hubar\n\nThough it is difficult to separate fact from fiction or bias regarding Fihr, it is presumed by modern scholars that the general story is true."
 
 game_concept_abd_hubar_ibn_khuzaima:0 "Abd-Hubar ibn Khuzaima"
 game_concept_abd_hubar_ibn_khuzaima_desc:0 "Abd-Hubar ibn Khuzaima was the son and heir of [khuzaima_al_zuhra|E] and the later patriarch of the al-Zuhra family. His name - 'Slave of War' - was chosen by his father because he intended on training him to be a warrior of the same quality as [fihr_ibn_kilab_ibn_zayd|E], under whom he trained as an apprentice. He accompanied his father on his campaigns as a young boy, so that he might learn how to command, but was sent to the family stronghold of Dozzan before the [battle_of_sulaymaniyan_fix|E].\n\nAfter his father's death, he swore an oath to kill a thousand [Concept('wardenism','Wardenites')|E] and avenge Khuzaima, to never to marry or enjoy life until he gained vengeance. Rising to lead the [black_confederation|E] at the age of 18, he led the coalition against Khalid al-Asir and other Wardenite lords in a campaign stretching from 658 to 668, when he was cornered in Dozzan by Khalid al-Asir and a rival coalition of Wardenites. Official Wardenite and [Concept('ritualism','Ritualist')|E] histories record that he fought and slew Khalid al-Asir in single combat, as well as three other lords, before retreating to his keep and committing suicide, though not before killing the women of his family to prevent their capture."

 game_concept_black_confederation:0 "Black Confederation"
 game_concept_black_confederation_desc:0 "The Black Confederation was a [Concept('ritualism','Ritualist')|E] alliance formed and led by [khuzaima_al_zuhra|E] to drive the [Concept('wardenism','Wardenites')|E] out of [sarradon|E]. So named because of the black flags the al-Zuhra clan used, it viciously contested Wardenite control of Sarradon and was one of the most successful Ritualist coalitions.\n\nAfter gaining success in the [battle_of_the_mubaaizun_fix|E], Khuzaima al-Zuhra led the Black Confederation against the Wardenite leader Khalid al-Asir in the [battle_of_sulaymaniyan_fix|E] in 658 IS, where Khuzaima was shot in the throat and killed. The Black Confederation nearly collapsed, but came under the control of Khuzaima's heir, [abd_hubar_ibn_khuzaima|E], who led the Confederation to victory against Khalid al-Asir in 660 IS, but suffered from extensive defeats in 663 and 665, collapsing by 668 with the death of Abd-Hubar ibn Khuzaima."

 game_concept_ritualism_desc:0 "Ritualism (also known as Sophocoism) is one of the two primary historical religions in [sarradon|E] (as opposed to their rivals, [wardenism|E]), and is regularly agreed to be the longest practiced religion in the known world. Focusing on worship of the 1001 Steps of [GetBuilding('01_sophocos').GetName] - a stairway leading up to a massive and inert [Concept('the_towers','Tower')|E] in central Sarradon, the only thing the famously sectarian Ritualists agree upon is that their faith is based around the possibly mythical journey of several pilgrims up the steps, where they faced a new trial upon each and an Angel taught them a life lesson that assisted them in making it to the next.\n\nWhether or not the journey happened, an angel or god was involved, if the tower is material or metaphorical, if the religion has many gods or not, whether the religion has angels or does not, whether the angels or god(s) are human, a higher power, humans who have become a higher power, forces of nature, and so on, are hotly debated by several hundred competing sects who regularly come to blows for reasons as basic as whether a passage about pouring tea was about pouring tea or if the tea is symbolic for humanity's latent desire for discovering the third hand of the forty-seven gods of sand and moon (as preached by the Mahadakist sect, who famously butchered the Lulawadii sect for agreeing with them in every point besides that the forty-seven gods were actually of the sand and sun).\n\nIt is hotly debated whether Wardenism, along with dozens of other major Sarradonian religions, is actually its own religion or yet another Ritualist sect that has broken off from the whole."
