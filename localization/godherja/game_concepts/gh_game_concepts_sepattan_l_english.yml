 game_concept_nattanan_biozone: "Nattanan Highlands"
 game_concept_nattanan_biozone_desc: "The Nattanan Highlands are a rugged, untamed region of tropical rainforests and jagged mountains that dominate Dahangon's north. It has been the home of the isolationist Nattanan people for millennia. The Nattanan people’s mastery of nature magic and the defensive nature of the region has allowed them to maintain a hunter gatherer lifestyle while rejecting all forms of civilization. Do not take this to mean they live in squalor; their magic turns the jungle into a cornucopia of game and food."

 game_concept_liberation_of_nattanan: "Liberaters of Nattanan"
 game_concept_liberation_of_nattanan_desc: "Eons ago, the Twin Gods Tarfal and Jerneim, alongside the God of Fire, Korlacu, sealed away Akkharadahamma the Undying, freeing the Nattanan from his dark tyranny. The Gods thereafter taught the Nattanan the paths of living in harmony with nature, dwelling together with them in the verdant paradise they created. \n\nYet this blissful time was not to last. For Korlacu, enamored by the power he had wielded against the Lord of Death, sought to reach greater heights even at the cost of upsetting the balance. Thus began the Sundering War, a brutal conflict that would see the God of Fire fall and the Twin Gods vanish from the world evermore.\n\nStill, their followers remain faithful, ever striving to uphold the paths their lords once taught and walked."

 game_concept_twin_deceivers: "Twin Deceivers"
 game_concept_twin_deceivers_desc: "Crucial to the ultimate defeat of Akkharadahamma was Korlacu’s forging of Darksteel. Yet, when the dust settled, the Twin Gods came to see their brother’s machinery as a heresy and a challenge to their might. This rift split the Nattanan in twain, as Korlacu’s followers labored to better their lives through innovation. Tensions mounted until they culminated in deceit, and a single errant blow ignited the brutal Sundering War - where the God of Fire will fall in a mighty [Concept('korlacu_prophecy','final stand')|E]."

 game_concept_korlacu_prophecy_desc: "After the Twin Gods forced Korlacu beyond the [Glossary('Carleh Sogotom','GH_CARLEH_SOGOTOM_GLOSS')], Jerniem finally slew his errant brother, restoring peace in Nattanan. The Twin Gods wearily rejoiced in their victory — only for their celebration to be shattered upon their return, as they beheld the Sacred Grove engulfed in flames. As they sought to extinguish the fires, Korlacu’s voice echoed across the burning grove and uttered these words: \nFrom ashes, the Flame God will rise, \nTo burn the garden ‘neath scarlet skies. \nThe twin gods’ reign shall swiftly fall, \nAs fire consumes, it conquers all."
 
 game_concept_great_betrayal: "Great Betrayal"
 game_concept_great_betrayal_desc: "Crucial to the ultimate defeat of Akkharadahamma was Korlacu’s forging of Darksteel. Yet, when the dust settled, the Twin Gods came to see their brother’s machinery as a threat to the great balance. Wise Tarfal tried to reason with Korlacu, who in his madness refused. This rift split the Nattanan in twain, as Korlacu continued to hoard weapons of great power. Tensions mounted until they culminated in deceit, and a single errant blow ignited the brutal Sundering War - where the God of Fire will fall in a mighty [Concept('korlacu_prophecy','final stand')|E]."

 game_concept_holy_hunts: "Holy Hunts"
 game_concept_holy_hunts_desc: "Suksinalmicsule, or Holy Path of Hunts, are sacred rituals dedicated to the god Jerniem. The Hunt first involves emulating his feat of ritualistically crafting a bow from magically hardened vines. Those successful in doing so are then tasked to hunt a creature designated as the Jersugu, or prey, by the High Priest of the Sepattan in order to maintain balance in the jungle. \n\nEach year, the Jersugu may vary and can range from a pack of ravenous beasts, a certain species of fruit bat, or a magical beast from the deep jungle - all depending on what is needed to achieve true balance."
