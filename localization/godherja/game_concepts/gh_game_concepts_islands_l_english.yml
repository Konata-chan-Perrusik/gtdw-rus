 game_concept_shatteredisles:0 "Shattered Isles"
 game_concept_shatteredisles_desc:0 "The bluntly descriptive name given to the massive archipelago which lies north of the Sea of Empires. Somewhat reminiscent of a finely crafted pottery disc, thrown violently against the ground to splinter into countless sherds. Perplexingly, some smaller islands have a frustrating habit of shifting position, even rising from the sea or falling below it as if pushed by an unseen hand. Hundreds of [Concept('marchers','Marcher')|E] and [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] mapmakers have lost years of their life (and even their sanity) in vain attempts to count their number, and most modern scholars dismiss such endeavors as wasteful attempts at knowing the unknowable. Modern estimates put the number of islands in the high thousands or even low tens of thousands.\n\nSome scant evidence exists to suggest the isles were not always thus. In a few areas can be found the time-worn remains of nameless cities and temples, whose ruins sprawl across dozens of individual islands. In other areas, locals note that certain collections of sheer jutting rocks will, if gazed at from the right angle, appear to form into a recognizable and contiguous mountain. Intriguing clues to be sure, but most Aversarian scholars have trouble taking them seriously. If the Shattered Isles were once consolidated into one or more large landmasses, what manner of force could possibly be capable of breaking them asunder? It would be a feat far beyond the ken of any [magi|E]'s wildest imagination, and even surpassing those spells now known only in myths and legends."
 
 #CHARACTERS
 
 game_concept_hameh:0 "Hameh"
 game_concept_hameh_desc:0 "Hameh, the Viridescent Prophet, is the name given to the mystical figure who first taught the Falamai the worship of the Deep Ones. Once a notorious pirate pillaging the [shatteredisles|E], Hameh was believed drowned after a failed battle at sea with a rival captain. To the surprise of his tribe however, Hameh returned from the ocean depths a changed man — if "man" he could still even be called. For Hameh emerged with his hair crowned with barnacles, his left arm changed into that of a Brittlestar, and his skin clad in the green scales from which his new epithet was taken. Hameh taught his awestruck people of the gods that lived beneath, and instructed them how to perform the rituals needed to appease, and even converse with them. What happened to Hameh afterward, none can now say, but some whisper that the Viridescent Prophet still lives in the deep, waiting with the gods below to emerge at the appointed time."
 
 game_concept_araran:0 "Araran"
 game_concept_araran_desc:0 "Born on the aptly named Shipbreaker Isle, Araran was one of the greatest Walakon leaders, sometimes equated with Bibloseia himself. He united a considerable portion of the Western Isles and challanged Aversarinas Aautokrata, conducting many raids on their largest cities and earning a special place in a large pantheon of imperial boogeymen. Unfortunately, due to the brutality of [dybolitos_sto_thallas|E], much of his life remains shrouded in mystery. There is scarcely a culture in the Sea of Empires that doesn't credit one of their heroes with slaying Araran, while Welki themselves claim that, having reached old age, he sailed off towards the [sea_tower|E] and shall return one day to lead their people to glory."
 
 game_concept_xymarchos:0 "Xymarchos of Naupyrna"
 game_concept_xymarchos_desc:0 "Xymarchos is perhaps the most famous statesman of Imperial Island. He first appears in written record in 80 IS on the list of the city's Popular Assembly members, but his meteorical rise to prominence truly started with [imas_aanios|E]. He was on the walls of the city during its defence, one of the few politicians to do so and survive. He also coordinated the rebuilding of Naupyrna after the raid, mobilising a force of workers from all over Imperial Island, allowing him to assume dictatorial power shortly after. He had great plans of re-establishing Naupyrna as the centre of [aversaria|E], conducting massive public works projects and building up Outaradeikón's navy during his decade of rule. Unfortunately, the great debts he accrued in Oraispol combined with his burning ambition made him a great deal of enemies. He was assassinated in 96 IS in broad daylight by a conspiracy of Etepezean merchants and his enemies is the Public Assembly, and his political achievements were largely squandered in the following years of infighting. Still, he remains a hero for the citizens of the city, ostensibly celebrated even by the descendants of his killers"

 game_concept_dybolitos_sto_thallas_desc:0 "The Harrowing of the Seas was a brutal, decades-long [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] military campaign launched by Aautokratir Aexionrax in 162 IS, which effectively ended the Shamrani maritime hegemony. It was an answer to centuries of slights against Aversarians, chief among them [imas_aanios|E]. Fought all over the Sea of Empires, the Harrowing was a campaign of extermination against Walakon peoples. While the Aautokrata claimed victory in the conflict, they were never able to truly quash Walakon resistance, their remenants surviving on the islands along the coast of Kalathipsomi."
 
 game_concept_imas_aanios:0 "Imas Aanios"
 game_concept_imas_aanios_desc:0 "The Day of Sorrow is the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] name for a daring raid on the city of Naupyrna conducted by a Walakon leader [araran|E] in 83 IS. Half the city went up in smoke, including Outaradéibiblikon, possibly the largest Aversarian library at the time which housed much of its early literature. The extent of the damages combined with the enormous tribute demanded by the Welki led to the city almost being abandoned, its continued existence owed to the tremendous effort of the stateman [Concept('xymarchos','Xymarchos')|E], who mobilised workers from all over the Island to help with rebuilding. Still, the raid heavily contributed to the Imperial Isle's decline in political strength and remains to this day one of the most traumatic events in Aversarian history, the humiliation of defeat never truly forgotten."

 game_concept_little_chevalie_beyond_the_sea:0 "Little Chevalie Beyond the Sea"
 game_concept_little_chevalie_beyond_the_sea_desc:0 "A popular phrase used to describe the Diorenic Isles, the term was first used in Dumard d'va Lafiette's 'Annotated Seafarer's Guide to the Lesser Isles, Rocks and Sundry'.\n\nIn it, Dumard recognizes that relations between the Islanders and Chevalie has cooled after Diorenic knights fought alongside the Champion during the [red_river_war|E], yet in the very next chapter, disparages the islanders as 'akin to Port den la Bastion if it was sunk beneath the waves and colonised by fish babbling in a near-unrecognizable bastardisation of our beautiful tongue.'"
