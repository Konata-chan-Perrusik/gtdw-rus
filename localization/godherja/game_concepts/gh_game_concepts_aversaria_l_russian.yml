Результаты (помимо нескольких серийных убийств) были не мгновенными, но быстро стали очевидны в течение десятилетия. Когда маги стали более разрушительными, чем когда-либо, Аверсария стала свидетелем стремительного роста числа и масштабов гражданских войн и внутренних конфликтов, причем в 1178 году было убито в десять раз больше знати, чем за все десятилетие, предшествовавшее Одрстанда.\n\nЭшрей, лидер Ораиспольской автократии в [Concept ('imperial_civil_war','имперскую гражданскую войну')|E], во  время Одрстанда.

Хотя имперская гражданская война была одной из тысяч гражданских войн в Аверсарианской Автократии за годы её существования, именно она положила конец империи и привела к появлению [Concept('the_fog','Тумана')|E], а Эшрей (один из претендентов в войне) вызвал [Concept ('frodbrokna','Фродброкна')|E].\n\nВойна началась после загадочной смерти Автократа Анесимасиоса и обвинения в том, что его жена, Аксиотея, отравила его.

Partic [magi|E] wreaked great havoc on Aversarian supply lines, and the combined force soon drove the Aversarian forces back east. The lines eventually settled in eastern Muisle, where trenches and battlements were dug so that Aversarian Magi could throw fire onto the fields while obscuring themselves from Chevalien griffon riders. This period of static warfare was reinforced by the creation of multiple siege castles by both sides.\n\nThe war ended in 1251 IS when the Marcher-Partic alliance commenced an all-out assault against Nicanoneus' forces, timing their assault alongside a raid by the [Concept('liches','Lich')|E] Ilnar Illadir. Nicanoneus was maimed by a firebolt from a Partic Magi and during his two-week coma, his forces were routed back east into the Black Mountains, where he would reorganize his men and realm into Epavarion - the Ebony League. The Marchers on the other hand, would later be betrayed by the Partics in the [rohrian_annex|E], leading to the loss of Eastern Rohr to the invaders."

The beginning of the war is considered to be the massive series of raids perpetrated by the E'hat'm queen Iezatha of the Baotaadar against Imperial shipping in 963 IS, in flagrant violation of the various treaties that had been signed with the E'hat'mic rulers of the southern archipelago. In response to these provocations, Aautokratia Alcandrea proclaimed that the E'hat'm, as had been displayed, were impossible to negotiate with, and began laying plans for an invasion of unimaginable scale and scope, to begin as soon as the fleet was assembled. Lacking any formal navy, however, the Aautokratia chose to send out a proclamation across the Aautokrata, promising land in Krehejad to any who joined the fleet, and great rewards to the first to set foot upon the island. This offer was seen as incredibly appealing by the impoverished Islanders, and soon the various mooring points were filled to the brim with enthuisiastic crews, rubbing shoulders with a massive collection of State Legions, all preparing for the operation. In addition, they were joined by a sizable contingent of slaves, offered freedom and the right to settle on the islands should they serve with distinction.\n\nCome the spring of 966 IS, the fleet embarked, and though the voyage itself was not without incident—with several Islander captains taking the opportunity to assail their rivals—the chaos which the invasion would come to be known for by its veterans truly began when flags belonging to the E'hat'm were spotted ahead. Behind them, however, was land, which prompted a mad rush by several vessels to be the first to claim their promised reward. The battle itself, immortalized as the [battle_of_the_imperial_sea|E], ended in victory for the Empire, and though the war would continue for the next several years, by 967 IS the land grants were doled out to those who had earned them, and the Archexate of Krehejad was born, a client kingdom subservient to the Empire."

Pitted against the assembled navy of the E'hat'm—a people who had been sailing the high seas since before the Aautokrata had even been created—was the Imperial fleet, assembled from countless Islander flotillas, Legions, and noble entourages. The battle has a well-earned reputation for chaos, as both sides lacked rigid command structures, with individuals Legons and captains having near-complete control of their ships. As a result, once battle was joined, formation broke apart completely as each vessel chose its own individual targets, while Imperial and E'hat'mic [magi|E] decimated entire flotillas.\n\nSoon, the chaos spilled onto the land, as Islander vessels and ambitious Legons rushed ahead to claim the rewards promised to the first to make landfall, resulting in several instances of friendly fire as Aversarian vessels fought for the honor. In an unexpected twist, however, this chaotic landfall would lend the Empire an advantage, as the E'hat'mic fleets who tried to retreat onto the land often found their ports of origin already occupied. The Battle of the Imperial Sea is considered to have ended when the remnants of Iezatha's fleet chose to flee Krehejad, retreating to the southern colony of Ketruna."

The treaty was signed in the city of Dielecport, which to this day bears a monument commemorating peace. Dielecender delegates proved to be crucial to the success of the negotiations, as they not only provided smooth translation, but also aided in explaining to both parties the cultural nuances of their counterparts.\n\nAs stipulated in the treaty, Marcher territories in the [shatteredisles|E] were conceded to Aversaria, beginning a centuries-long period of insurrection by the islanders against Aversarian rule. Their holdings in the Black Mountains were also conceded, largely due to the [bloodblight|E] wiping out Chevalien settlers in the area. The isle of Dielec was leased to the Aversarians, but while the island nominally remained a part of Chevalie, Aversaria exercised full control over the island and its lucrative port.\n\nFinally, and to great controversy, the Marchers were acknowledged by the Aversarians to be a cousin race.

While initially passing through the mountain passes with little difficulty, the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E] were suddenly set upon by an army thrice larger than initial estimates of the Krupleg's entire population. Worse, the tribe's champions were all enhanced by Shimmerstone, and swiftly wrought havoc among the Aversarian lines. The entire expeditionary force—including Arch-Magi Nexios—were slain in the battle now known as Nexios' Folly, dealing a severe blow to the Mayikrata's prestige and allowing Aautokratir Clytomedes to exercise more authority over the academy.\n\nDespite this defeat, the Mayikrata was still able to secure a source of Shimmerstone, when Magister Axliades journeyed to the north and was named blood-kin by the Krupleg after proving himself in a raid. The Krupleg then agreed to sell a limited amount of Shimmerstone as long as the line of Axliades ruled the 'magic tribe'. The Mayikrata immediately elevated Axliades to Arch-Magi upon his return, and named his dynasty the titular rulers of the academy's northernmost territories, a practice that continued even long after the actual dynasty's extinction."

Sixteen Legions, mostly natives of Kalathipsomi and local State Legions, marched south from lines across the Pathos River after the defeat of the Varicadd Imperial Clique. Hoping to winter in the nearby homesteads, they instead ended up marching straight into the vanguard of the Witch-Breaker's right flank. After a disastrous series of battles for both sides, the Legions retreated... and did so straight into the center of the Sjalvolki horde.\n\nThe following battle would last for nearly six months, as the Sjalvolki and Imperials brutally fought through the worst winter in Kalathipsomian memory, more soldiers freezing or starving to death than dying in any battle. By the end the Sjalvolki would come out victorious, however, and the shattered remnants of the Legions would disband, join the last remnants of Imperial control under the treacherous Legon Kresox, or retreat south to be wiped out at the Elysian Pass.\n\nWhile overshadowed by the Battle of the Elysian Pass, most scholars agree that the Ten Trees was the last time the Aversarian Legions posed any threat to Cenware's horde, and veterans of the battle often speak bitterly of the 'glory' of the Pass and the forgotten misery of the Ten Trees. Today, there is little more to remember the battle besides the oft-found bones and scraps from hundreds of forgotten skirmishes, or of the six surviving trees in the clearing."

Axiaothea took advantage of this opening and swiftly moved her forces through the Pass, taking the Aeschraeist vanguard by surprise, and resulted in nearly half of Aeschraes' professional soldiers being trapped in the north. Axiaothea then took this time to raze an already battered southeast Opakhasia, claiming retribution for their supposed betrayal two years ago, resulting in the completion of the region's desolation.\n\nAt the closing days of the war, Axiaothea's forces were able to encircle the battered remnants of Aeschraes' legions—ironically in the very ruins of Asarathos—with the rest of her forces besieging the walls of Tinitida for what looked like the imminent end of the war. Axiaothea gave over command to her loyal general and childhood friend, Magister-Legon Mathotos 'Black of Eyes' Asonox, as she travelled back east to deal with the [blue_robe_revolt|E].

On the other hand, Axiaotheist forces were similarly stymied in their Siege of Tinitida, traditionally the 'gateway' to Etepezea from the east.\n\nThis state of affairs would change in 1199 IS when, displeased with the lack of progess being made, Aautokratir Aeschraes himself arrived at the frontline. Alongside his [magi|E] Nycenea 'the Void Walker' and Yind 'the Fairest Witch', Aeschraes tore apart the walls of Asarathos with a blast of pure force.\n\nThe fall of the fortress was seen as an opportunity by Aeschraes' commanders to make a name for themselves as the first to set foot in Aironoi. Incompetent leadership under Arch-Legan Kryla Katharitanox along with infighting amongst Aeschraes's senior military leadership (a tactic often employed by Aeschraes, who faced constant paranoia that his leading generals would plan a coup were they not so preoccupied with one another) meant that in their excitement to finally break through they had left almost all lands between the Pass of Mountain-Kings and the fortifications across the straits from Asiupoli almost completely defenseless. Furthermore, Katharitanox had ordered nearly every single auxiliary unit of Battle Magi north with hopes to use them to rapidly overturn any further fortresses along the northern bay.\n\nThis rash march to the north resulted in the creation of openings in the Aeschraeist lines, which were taken advantage of by Axiaothea in the ensuing [western_incursion|E]."

This resulted in the escalation of tensions with the succeeding elected Aautokratirs, who after Phanagorax, were usually traditionalist Aersodiaxians.\n\nThis precarious balance would end in 156 IS, when Aexionarax, grandson of Phanagorax, defected with a number of fellow dragon riders and conquered the city of Tinitida. He would declare himself to be the rightful Aautokratir and would wage war against the Aautokratir in Oraispol, Dhacï'xen.

The Makleans claimed that the city and its inhabitants had not been 'purified' and in fact violated sacred Divine Law by using soulless Time magics. This is largely accepted to have been a cynical move, as Kethemodes declared that since the city had never been placed under a Governorate during Maklea's Reforms and thus owed hundreds of years of taxes directly to the throne. The city refused, and shortly thereafter the Imperial Army was sent in a punitive expedition.\n\nThe following Ixsian War would last for several months. While the Ixsians possessed archaic armaments and a very small military, they did however possess over a dozen functioning suits of prized Runic Armor and archives still filled with ancient [Concept('ritual','Rituals')|E] and artifacts that had not been seen in centuries. The Ixsians used these gifts to great effect, but new rituals developed after the Ixsians vanished and a swarm of trained wyverns from the Governor of Etepezea's menagerie eventually overcame the defenders. The Ixsians would soon surrender, and much of their great archives were looted, their riches stripped, and the city placed under Imperial authority.

  game_concept_miniature_war_desc:89 "A conflict that was intermittently waged from 1184 to 1229 IS, the so-called ‘Miniature’ War saw numerous factions of [magi|E] battle both beneath the [mayikrata|E]’s cavernous halls and atop its most remote peaks Following the deaths of Arch-Magi Olitaxinos, Magister Peltra, and most of the Mayikratan Ruling Council during the [rathiax_incident|E]—as well as the execution of Arch-Magi Simoisius after the assassination of Aautokratir Anesimasios ‘Kindblood’—a power vacuum formed within the Academy that sent ambitious Magi to joust for power and authority.\n\nThe factions initially formed along the lines of the [imperial_civil_war|E], with the ‘Aaimoinos’ or ‘Bloodwine’ faction led by Magister Zilic Nivagdarax reportedly backing Aeschraes, and the ‘Mistax’ or ‘Reform’ faction led by Magister Ludic Mscra ostensibly supporting Axiaothea. This, in addition to the vast amount of powerful spells cast during the conflict, led many to regard the war as a microcosm of the mainland war.\n\nThe conflict remained in a deadlock for much of its duration, before it was abruptly shattered by [frodbrokna], which resulted in the deaths of most magi-combatants and resulted in the rise of another faction who would demand instead for the Mayikrata’s independence. Led by the Magi Terrox - a contemporary (and poorly regarded) colleague of Aeschraes (whom with he hosted a largely one-sided rivalry) and Axiaothea (with whom he hosted a far more one-sided romance) - the faction would eventually achieve victory in 1229 IS after a surprisingly successful purge of his last rivals among the Academy staff and ruling Council."

Barely an hour passed however, when the city then declared independence from Terrox and worked with several nearby power-brokers to drive out the invading legions and also obtain neutrality from foreign affairs in return for its own safety."

The ensuing battle was apocalyptic, resulting in the utter destruction of the academy's testing grounds (and several hundred yards beyond), and lasting for an unprecedented six hours — a feat previously heard only in fables and folklore. The end reportedly came with Peltra goading Axiaothea to deal the finishing blow to Aeschraes, resulting in the former turning her spells against the Magister instead. The Aironoian is then said to have readied an insanely powerful spell that swept the field with fire, slaying many of the assembled Magi and Magisters. The Mayikratan council record, the only remaining account of the incident, reads:\n\n#inno_quote “The foul Axiaothea, so murderous in her famous blood-rage that had consumed so many innocents over so many years, prepared a fiery spell no doubt prepared from the rituals of an ancient and evil non-human civilization. We of the Council of the Mayikprolollan bravely told her this: ‘We will not bow! We will not prostrate to so foul a one as you!’"#!\n\n#inno_quote “Foul Axiaothea then ignited Arch-Magi Olitaxinos and sent him over the side of the mountain, to which the Council of the Mayikprolollan bravely then said: ‘We will do as you say!

The perpetrators were identified to be the Azarg Kutahnu͞ug, a culture hitherto regarded as mythical boogeymen of the Kartharaddi, whose very existence was only revealed by the numerous and gruesome ritual blood writings left at the (by all accounts horrific) scene of the massacre.\n\nOver 4,000 inscribed words were discovered at the site, written in the tribe's theological glyph language (which took the work of some twenty years and the life work of an entire wing of the [mayikrata|E] to fully decipher), describing in painstakingly detailed poems the exact torture inflicted upon the priestesses; why their gods had seen fit to demand their death; a seemingly random chosen three of up to eighty-six different holy founding myths; and multiple words that Aversarian [magi|E] still struggle to fully understand that have since been called '[magiskrit|E]'.\n\nA livid Theyssia—who is said to have considered Aeha a mentor—ordered two exceptionally ill-fated expeditions (and four lost ones) to investigate, apprehend and eliminate the Azarg Kuthanu͞ug.

The bastard son of the noblewoman Kena Detheniax and (if rumors are to believed) Vedegar Brethaniac, the semi-legendary master of many of the criminal organizations in Aversaria during the peak of the [imperial_civil_war|E]. Iron-Spike was born in relative squalor in the shadows of the [Concept('mayikprolollans','Mayikprolollan')|E] in Prose on 1202 IS.\n\nCunning and shrewd, Demetros managed to use intrigue, guile, and intimidation to take the majority of his mother's lands after her death in 1209 IS; either killing or removing her trueborn heirs in the decade after her death. Demetros soon ruled most of his family's lands and began to rapidly expand them through further subterfuge and campaigning for the next decade.\n\nDemetros is perhaps most known (or infamous) for swearing fealty to Aautokratir Aeschraes, using the backing of the 'Lord of the Ashes' to further extend his domain towards the Black Mountains and begin what many considered a legal criminal organization that held much sway throughout Etepezea. Soon, Demetros had become known as one of the right hand men to Aeschraes, and many lords remained under the Aautokratir's grip entirely for fear of the assassins known to be employed by the Iron-Spike and his myriad of criminal connections.\n\nDemetros was slain in 1229 IS by Legan Isacea of Legio XXI 'Axiaothea' during the [Concept('the_vilnian_assault','Vilnian Assault')|E], alongside his counterpart [karthyn_delenel|E] in a duel with Isacea. With Iron-Spike's death (with no accepted heir), order in Kalathipsomi rapidly collapsed into infighting between revolting slaves, military commanders, criminal organizations and local nobility, and would remain in such a state until the Sjalvolki [Concept('sjalvolki_migration','Migrations')|E] in the 1250s."

Legon of Legio XIV 'Chain-Forgers', Delenel was known for his brutality and efficiency in command of his legion primarily in dealing with slave revolts throughout the [imperial_civil_war|E] and afterwards in service to Aautokratir Aeschraes.\n\nDelenel is perhaps most infamous for being considered the mentor to Gorassos 'Skull-Taker', the infamous 'attack hound' to Aeschraes who cut bloody swathes through [aversaria|E] alongside Delenel in fear campaigns to horrify the population back into order under the rotting foundations of the Oraispol Aautokrata. Delenel was given commands of five legions for this assignment, as well as his personal noble legions from his families extensive estates in Opakhasia and Malcois, and is generally credited for Aeschraes being able to control the two regions for the later part of his reign. Known for skinning his enemies alive, Delenel would use his limited magical ability to prolong their lives and would often also castrate, de-tongue, de-hand, and then skin notable captives in front of their men or families while giving speeches in Aeschraes' name.\n\nDelenel would meet his end in 1229 IS at the hands Legan Isacea of Legio XXI 'Axiaothea' during the [Concept('the_vilnian_assault','Vilnian Assault')|E], alongside his compatriot [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] in a duel with Isacea. With Delenel's death, his legions immediately deserted Aeschraes' service, Opakhasia collapsed without his fear campaigns and Malcois was soon swept under the tides of the Iyrossi Rebellions.\n\nOften forgotten in popular accounts is that Delenel survived the Vilnian Assault though was mortally wounded. Abandoned by his allies and men, he returned to his estates in Opakhasia. There, his pupil Gorassos entered under signs of friendship and then beheaded his master for his collection of skulls, then raped and killed Delenel's family, servants, and slaves.

Initially an Aversarian legionary, Gurdurbok would take the north after deserting with fellow clansmen from his Legion (Legio XVII 'Pathos'), and would control the north under the command of [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E].\n\nWhen Iron-Spike was killed in the [Concept('the_vilnian_assault','Vilnian Assault')|E], Gurdurbok formally cut ties with Aversaria (in a very well written letter to Oraispol), and soon after began a war in the mountains with rebel [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Governor Methiad Dethlycan')|E] for control of the north. Gurdurbok was known for using freed slaves to do battle, and showed great cruelty to Aversarian settlers who resisted him. Despite this, and propaganda written by his rival Methiad showing him as a true barbarian, Gurdurbok was known for his great interest in literature, foreign theology, and the arts, and would often impress visiting emissaries by extensively debating these topics with them.\n\nGurdurbok met his end in 1247 IS with the arrival of Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun', child of the governor of Katraddia. Entering the region with his refugee army, Nicanoneus was routed around the eastern mountains after his defeat by Cenware 'Witch-Breaker' in the Mountain Gate War.\n\nNicanoneus would be courted by both sides in the [Concept('the_black_mountain_war','Black Mountain War')|E] and would use forces from both Gurdurbok and his rival to score a victory against the Witch-Breaker in the Battle of Bergkoga, but would soon after be forced back north. Followed hotly by the Sjalvolki, Nicanoneus would blame his 'allies' for the defeat and deemed both too much of a liability for his cause. He would surprise and kill Gurdurbok in an assault on his estates, and then execute Governor Methiad and assume control of the north, ending the north's period of civil conflict."

Not only this, but Methiad received numerous arms and funding from the [marchers|E] of [chevalie|E], with whom she had made numerous deals for generous land and resource grants in the Black Mountains. With this force she fought Iron-Spike and his ally and her chief rival [oulnir_gurdurbok|E].\n\nWhen Iron-Spike was killed in the [Concept('the_vilnian_assault','Vilnian Assault')|E], the guerilla war between Methiad and Gurdurbok broke into full open conflict, and would consume the north for the rest of her life. Both sides would fail to make substantial gains, especially with the rest of Kalathipsomi in open collapse, and Methiad's position was thrown into even greater doubt with the collapse of her allies in Chevalie (with the disappearance of High King Gardfrei) and the Mayikrata (with [Concept('sjalvolki_migration','Cenware Witch-Breaker leading the sack of the academy')|E]).\n\nWhen Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' arrived from the east alongside his refugee legions, Methiad and Gurdurbok both attempted to [Concept('the_black_mountain_war','court the foreigner to their sides in the conflict')|E]. Using forces from both Methiad and Gurdurbok, Nicanoneus would score a victory against the Sjalvolki at the Battle of Bergkoga but quickly be routed north soon after. Blaming his 'allies', Nicanoneus soon after ambushed and killed Gurdurbok. Methiad suspected she was his next target, and attempted to send assassins as well as her personal legion to kill her former pawn. The assassins failed however, and her legion quickly deserted to Nicanoneus. Surrounded and without allies, she attempted to flee to Chevalie, but would be captured and then executed for incompetence by Nicanoneus in 1247 IS. Her attempt to escape west, along with another attempted assassination against Nicanoneus by her followers soon after, would be used by the Black Sun as an excuse to invade west into Chevalie in the [ash_war|E] soon after."

While other mayikprolollans would rise and fall in fame and fortune, the Pathosixyic Academies (the Mayikprolollan sto Spathas, sto Thallas, and chief of all the [mayikrata|E]) would not only be the first three to be formed but also become the informal leaders of all other academies.\n\nAfter their true founding in the eigth century IS, the leaders of the three Academies would convene to write the second edition (and the most important) of the Concordial Pact and, several years later, the Treatise of Good Practice, which would come to dictate the proper and legal teachings of all Aversarian Magi along with the correct usage of magic. Not only schools, the Pathosixyic Academies would also become economic centers and the most important laboratories on [the_continent|E], both building the largest known archive of magical knowledge and artifacts on [aeras|E] and becoming centers for learning and experimentation. Despite this, however, the Pathosixyic Academies would become known for their increasingly political nature. Using their unique position of isolating and controlling the children who would one day be the most influential powerbrokers of Aversaria, the Mayikprolollans often sought to turn their students into political puppets through a mix of social pressure, financial debt, and very often even blackmail and threats.\n\nThe legacy of the Academies as prestigious institutions of learning would end after [frodbrokna|E] and the collapse of the empire during the [month_of_the_magi|E] in 1218 IS, when the Mayikrata would declare itself an independent aautokrata separate from greater Aversaria, followed by similar declarations from its two child academies."

  game_concept_blood_senate_desc:89 "A 'Blood Senate' is both the name for the accepted succession system of the Aversarinas Aautokrata and also for the actual gathering of nobility to perform it.\n\nFirst began in 243 IS after Aautokratir Akalionixos declared that whichever one of his sons could prove themselves the strongest [magi|E] may succeed him, he was soon after murdered by his daughter Maklea in an impromptu duel, who was shortly after declared aautokratia and spent the rest of her reign largely hunting down her brothers. This was its origin however, and a thousand years of formalization and correction to attempt to prevent massive civil wars nearly every generation have led to its modern iteration.\n\nIn the modern world, a Blood Senate is declared just after the time of mourning for the former Aautokratir. The high nobility of the realm choose an agreed upon location and each noble family puts forward one candidate to compete, though other members are allowed to volunteer as well (though this is taboo) and non-nobles are also allowed to join, though this is also taboo.\n\nDuring a Blood Senate, the assorted candidates compete in a bracketed tournament to find who is the most powerful Magi via duels to the death, with no mercy allowed at risk of disqualification. The last man (or woman) standing wins.\n\nOnly one Blood Senate has been won without [magic|E], by the Aversarian mercenary Nothyx, who used [antimagic|E] skills learned from the [marchers|E] to put down his competitors with nothing besides his sword."

While Aautokratir Phanagorax is often credited with the conquest of the Iyrossi Valley, most scholars agree that the conquest would not have been possible without Dethediax's skill (especially when compared to the oft debated competence of the Aautokratir).\n\nDethediax was known for her sharp wit and great knowledge of the Iyrossi, born from having been the master of Aversarian forts in northern Opakhasia before the Mytidon Campaign. Dethediax was appointed military governor of the valley after the conquests—often claimed to be the first governor of Malcois despite it not being an official Imperial province until 288 IS—and managed to create a code of laws and regulations that ensured the valley faced no major rebellion after her own death.\n\nWhile contemporaries accused Dethediax of Iyrossi sympathy, especially due to several portions of the law directly challenging the severity of Aversarian rule and circumventing many Imperial laws, it nonetheless managed to fuse old Iyrossi codes with Aversarian law to create a lasting peace between the two groups. Most notably, it used the Iyrossi rules of 'Blood Service' to create a palatable reasoning for the subjugation, and ensured that most Iyrossi would live as 'Autonomous Slaves' in independent communes named 'Iyroikons' which gave them far greater autonomy than most Aversarian slaves.\n\nWhile the Laws would be changed, rescinded, or reinforced multiple times during history (especially with the Theyssian Reforms in 766 IS), they nonetheless remained largely in place until the Iyrossi Rebellions in the 1200s."

  game_concept_westerly_breeze_desc:89 "North of the Sea Tower, at the edge of a secluded reef, lies a curiosity. Here a stone hand of immense scale juts from the sea, clutching in its grasp the splintered remnants of a wooden vessel. While presumably a part a larger statue its scale has meant that none have been able to dive deep enough to glimpse more than its wrist. When [aversaria|E] colonized the region, scholars noted it as a peculiarity, but being unable to identify the make of the vessel it was largely forgotten about for the time.\n\nThis all changed in 1022 IS when a startling observation was made by the scholar Machyos Nottiokos: the vessel clutched within the statue's grasp, once deemed to be of an unrecognizable yet distinctive design by previous scholars, was actually very clearly of contemporary Aversarian design. Leading the first expedition to examine the vessel in centuries, he determined that the heavily rotted wood couldn't have been harvested earlier than the 10th century IS. Indeed, one of the better preserved nails even bore a maker's mark from a blacksmithing guild still active in the Tinitida area.\n\nWhile this mystery would fruitlessly consume the next decade of Machyos' career, it largely remained a local curiosity and his work was ignored until the disappearance of the "Westerly Breeze". The vessel, a state of the art trade ship sporting a novel design, vanished without a trace in the midst of a magical storm in the Southern Isles. Noting that the sketches of the ship bore more than a passing resemblance to his research project, Machyos led a third and final major expedition to the site. There, tearing off a large section of rotted hull and carefully studying the reliefs, they discovered the faintest trace of the words "Westerly Breeze" carved onto it."

Any potential pairing must have a similar combined status, lest the marriage be considered unequal, with one wielding a greater influence due to the honor within their lineage. It is an old joke in Aversaria, perhaps as old as the Archexate itself, that a king might find himself unworthy of marrying a beggar."
