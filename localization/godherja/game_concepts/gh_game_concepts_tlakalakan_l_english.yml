  game_concept_mavixars_curse:0 "Mavixar's Curse"
  game_concept_mavixars_curse_desc:0 "The ancient Uakaloh faith was far more brutal than its modern incarnation. Priests now preach fellowship with others (for Tenese watches them as well (his eye the moon [aervalr|E])) and only the willing face sacrifice (for Tensese does not enjoy the company of angered souls). This change followed the sacrifice of Queen Mavixar of the Mijabixo, who cursed them after the brutal sacrifice of both her and her people.\n\nThe curse followed her sacrifice by Tlakalakan [magi|E]-King Azartic. Following her curse, they say a great blast of light followed her death, and the shocked Uakaloh stormed the temple and slew Azartic and his family. Despite this, they claim endless calamities in the [tlakalakan_migration|E] were brought from [axemati_tlakalaktli|E]. Tlakalakan legend states the curse’s words were:\n\n#N Damnation and horror to you, Azartic, and your kin and blood! Let your people know no peace as you still draw breath, and let them never settle in lands free from the blood of tragedy while a single of your kin still rules them. While your people still worship your ‘godly’ blood, so too shall theirs be tainted by despair! Damn you Azartic! And damn all you rule and ever shall!#"

  game_concept_tlakalakan_migration_desc:0 "The Tlakalakan people arrived in the known world from far-southern [sarradon|E] soon after the formation of modern [aversaria|E], and brought north a faith possibly as old as [ritualism|E]. While their reasons have become muddled, along with the history itself, Tlakalakan tales agree they fled from two evil empires that rose to their north and south and conquered their homeland. The mysterious and advanced Adabyss is commonly theorized to be one. The migrations were disastrous, with repeated attempts to settle down and rebuild their civilization destroyed by natural disaster, foreign invaders, or interal strife. The longest period of settlement recorded in their history lasts no more than two generations, during which they were subjugated by a divine lord.\n\nTlakalakans claim that the repeated disasters result from [mavixars_curse|E] and [axemati_tlakalaktli|E], a legacy which followed them into Rojihlat Mara. Their [necentlal_tlaklaktli|E], established in the 2nd century IS, was plagued with infighting and rebellion, as they struggled to preserve their new home against both the native tribes of the region and the Ritualists coming from the north.\n\nWhen the Far Eastern Mamuramat arrived in the region, they would ally with the Ritualists in return for Rojihlat Mara, only for a series of catastrophic defeats to critically destabilize their Federation. As their most recent attempt to find a home collapsed under the weight of rebellion and invasion, the Uakakloh made one more migration, fleeing Wardenites, Ritualists, and natives in order to reach the jungles of Cyrat."
  
  game_concept_xihuetzi:0 "Xihuetzi"
  game_concept_xihuetzi_desc:0 "The collapse of the [necentlal_tlaklaktli|E] was far from peaceful. With the armies of the Tlakalakans shattered by the [Concept('wardenism','Wardenite')|E] invaders, the native tribes of Rojihlat Mara, long held within the unhappy union, rose in revolt. Soon after, the Five Cities, the urban centers in which Tlaklakan power was concentrated, were set afire — the visible symbol of the Tlaklakan fall. Forced from their cities, the last army of the Necentlal soon found itself burdened with refugees, and tasked with finding any way to survive. After a failed campaign to retake the great city of Lexicatl — or rather its ruins — and with enemies closing in around them, a fateful decision was made. The last army, the last remnant of the Tlaklakans, would retreat into Cyrat, where it could wait until the chaos passed to reemerge.\n\nUpon reaching Cyrat, however, this dream was revealed as mere fantasy. As refugees continued to trickle in, it became necessary to push deeper into the jungle, suffering horrific losses in a desperate search for clean water or edible plants. Within four years of entering Cyrat, the entire leadership of the army was dead, and the last remnant of the Necentlal died with them. Under the guidance of the ancient priesthoods would the Tlaklakans push deeper into the jungle, setting foot upon ground from which no human had ever returned. And gradually, through compromise to the hostile environment, and through the mass death of the Tlaklakans, their society would morph into something different, something nearly indistinguishable from the tribes from whom they had fled. Their ancient and rich history was nearly forgotten, the art of writing nearly lost, and the ancient traditions of the Tlaklakan cultures left to rot.\n\nFor the Xihuetzi had not only claimed their cities, and their lands. It had claimed their civilization."

  game_concept_necentlal_tlaklaktli_desc:0 "When the Tlakalakans [Concept('tlakalakan_migration','migrated')|E] into Rojihlat Mara, they initially attempted to reconstruct the ancient organization of their society. After brief wars with the native realms upon their mass-arrival, they established several cities across the region, and between those cities established a diplomatic union. Soon after its creation, this 'Tlakalakan Federation', or 'Necentlal Tlakalaktli' in the Tlaklakan tongue, was extended to include many native tribes, who struggled to adapt to this new political order.\n\nDespite best attempts and mild interest, the Necentlal would face continual disaster and instability. The Tlakalakans blamed [axemati_tlakalaktli|E] and their ancient curse as endless rebellions, royal assassinations, famines and fell omens plagued the polity, repeatedly bringing it to the brink of collapse. Despite earnest wishes for equal union where all rulers could work together in peace, the natives never trusted them. Seeing the foreigners as strange and alien, and their cities and settlements as even more so, the union struggled to reconcile the differences between the state structures of the Tlaklakan and the traditions of the local tribes. This, along with the general instability, resulted in repeated civil wars, in which the natives broke from the Necentlal to war with the [magi|E]-Kings.\n\nThe Necentlal’s death followed wars with [Concept('ritualism','Ritualist')|E] and then [Concept('wardenism','Wardenite')|E] warlords. After centuries of struggle against Ritualism, the Magi-Kings agreed to ally against the Wardenites in return for suzerainty over Rojihlat Mara. Subsequent military disasters saw their Ritualist allies abandoning the region or joining the Wardenites, soon followed by a mass uprising by the Rojihlat natives. This [xihuetzi|E], or 'Downfall', would result in a mass-migration into the jungle of Cyrat, where the last ashes of the Necentlal would fade into history."

  game_concept_axemati_tlakalaktli_desc:0 "Tlakalakan legends believe in a curse of ill-fortune and that they shall never know peace for essentially, and have done so for most of history. This began some thousand years before the formation of [aversaria|E], when the Tlakalakan people were [Concept('mavixars_curse','cursed')|E] by Queen Mavixar upon her sacrifice to Tensese.\n\nWhile Uakakloh calls for only the willing to be sacrificed, this was not always so. The tales speak of a once far more warlike faith, where competing tribes sacrificed one another in order to fuel an endless demand for blood to Tensese, each sacrifice fueling their [Concept('magi','Magi-Kings')|E] with Tensese’s blessing. The Tlakalakans claimed one enemy was the Mijabixo, and that they captured the Mijabixo Queen Mavixar (often claimed to only be twelve) in a great raid. The Tlakalakan Magi-King, Azartic (tales often speaking of his great evils) sacrificed her upon their holiest altar and unleashed [mavixars_curse|E].\n\nFor fear of the curse, the Uakaklohans murdered Mavixar and his dynasty and then abandoned their cruel ways. The curse, regardless, continued, and brought upon [tlakalakan_migration|E] and their further [Concept('xihuetzi','downfall')|E]."
