 game_concept_peculiar_compromise_sunarwei:0 "Sunarwei Aagiokrata Compromise"
 game_concept_peculiar_compromise_sunarwei_desc:0 "While a lack of exaulting [magi|E] and aversarians seems contradictory to Aversarian desires for control, study of the political situation in Aironoi when the Aversarians began syncreticism efforts make it far more obvious the reasoning. While the Aversarians had allied the Öltenic, there was great fear among the nobility of the possibility of betrayal or rogue actors, and that the Öltenic horsemen could then either threaten the land trade routes going south through Sunarwei lands or even overwhelm the south before Aversaria could mobilize and cut the governate in half. So the [Concept('destruction_is_creation','pacifistic beliefs')|E] had to go."
 
 #GODS

 game_concept_destruction_is_creation:0 "Destruction of Kumhant's Shards is Creation."
 game_concept_destruction_is_creation_desc:0 "To this end, the Aversarians have encouraged a belief that while all living beings are indeed glass shards of the god Kumhant, destroying shards simply creates more, and just as a dead animal gives life to the earth under it, destroying can simply be seen as creating more life. While of questionable consistency with the rest of Sunarwei dogma, worshipers of the Aversarianized faith historically filled most southern armies afterwards, and often served as mercenaries abroad."
