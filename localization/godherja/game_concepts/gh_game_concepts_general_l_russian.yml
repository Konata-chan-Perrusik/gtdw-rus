King Pothacleas waged a legendary guerilla war against the Aversarians, so effective that it allowed him to bargain for the lives of his entire people at the cost of their enslavement and his life. He remains a legendary figure to both the Iyrossi people and military historians alike, as his battles and tactics remain studied even centuries after his death."

Even before their long fought campaign against Aversaria, they have mastered the use of their hostile landscape to inflict maximum casualties on their foes. If battles cannot be won by a single decisive victory than protracted warfare tactics are used instead, utilizing supply raids and sneak attacks at night to weaken the morale of and eventually starving their foes as weeks of supply shortages turn into months. Passing these kinds of warfare tactics down to the younger generations is a responsibility of tribal elders, making this a vital part of their culture as stubborn guerilla warriors determined to fight for freedom at any cost."

 game_concept_old_iyrossi_culture_desc:0 "Occurring primarily in the numerous ethnically Iyrossi rural towns dotting the cliffsides of outer Malcois, vendetta killings and sibling marriages are commonplace. The Iyrossi faith permits both, and even praises such acts as pious in the eyes of the Divine Court. Such practices are hard to wipe from the Iyrossi people altogether, as centuries of tradition and ritual are embedded into the various Iyrossi cultures themselves."

As hundreds of different ways to track time have passed, and time as modern humans know it has not always existed (possibly only truly starting after the Godherja) it is impossible to accurately date most of human history.\n\nRoughly, [aersanon|E] created the world after several aeons in the void, and then created humanity to attempt to make beings to converse with. Humanity was allowed to create its own kingdoms, all which worshipped Aersanon, but Aersanon grew tired of humanity's imperfections and created the [aelfir|E]. The Aelfir conquered and enslaved humanity and formed their own empires, and after several hundred thousand years, humanity rose up and destroyed the Aelfir and Aersanon both in the Godherja."

Rebuffed from Aironoi by the Astliks and recovering from the Last Dragon Rebellion, the Aversarians invaded the Marcher colonies in their ever-growing desire to dominate more lands.\n\nThe initial war was hard fought, with Yakub 'Illspeaker' eventually defeated, Marcher [antimagi|E] wreaked havoc upon the Aversarians using guerilla tactics against the rugged outlands of Kalathipsomi. The initial series of wars only ended in 569 IS, when both sides, thoroughly exhausted and struggling to resist outside threats while dealing with the other agreeing to draw a new border. Aversaria would gain the majority of Kalathipsomi with the Chevaliens retaining the Black Mountains and all lands west of them.\n\nSeveral smaller wars would be fought for the mountains themselves until 631 IS when the [bloodblight|E] wiped out much of Chevalie's nobility and the Marchers withdrew west, Aversarian settlers soon filling their former holdings.

While many scholars believe that it was simply poor luck, others have suggested that it was in fact a powerful [gedeora|E] which inflicted poor luck upon [the_continent|E]\n\nThe Chaos began with the invasion of the [arch_lich|E] Adwaga Adwakampy into Chevalie and the rise of the Aversarian [Concept('liches','Lich')|E] Count Themos in eastern Opakhasia. As the two Liches wreaked havoc, especially due to a collapse in Marcher authority and the Aversarian throne being sat on by a mere child, a powerful series of Gedeora began tearing Aversarian cities back and forth through the timeline seemingly at random. Further exacerbating this was a large civil war that quickly broke out between the governors of Kalathipsomi and Malcois in the midst of the invasions.\n\nNot long after, the [bloodblight|E] began its rampage across the world from Aversaria. With the southwest weakened from these calamities, the [Concept('kartharadd','Kartharaddi Imperium')|E] launched a massive invasion into Aversaria and conquered most of Malcois, only being beaten back after a brutal near fifty years of war which ended with the defeat of the last Kartharaddi army at the Battle of the Riduvian Barrows in 760 IS, marking the end of the Chaos."

She, along with her four children (the dragons Iluthunax, Parthagad, Olaxanat and Kutharax) proceeded to scour much of Aversaria, exacting tribute from local lords of wantonly slaughtering entire cities as they saw fit.\n\nArthenax slew the entirety of over six Aversarian Legions and over two hundred [magi|E] who attempted to stop her before finally being confronted by Aautokratia Aeliadias in a legendary duel in southern Opakhasia. Aeliadias proved herself the strongest Magi of a generation in killing the beast and her children. The magical flames conjured by Aeliadias were so powerful that Arthenax was burned away until her bones turned into blackened stone, and her remains still remain where they fell so long ago. While Arthenax is considered the last living dragon, it is unknown from where she came from, and the believed extinction is only due to the lack of verifiable reports of other dragons since."

They now uniformly worship what they call the 'Mistmother', a personification of the fog, who they believe speaks to them through it.\n\nFogeaters themselves have little remains of human sentience, generally little more than gibbering wrecks who have only retained enough sentience to perform raids and ambushes out of the foglands and kill themselves upon capture. Physically, they possess an unnaturally pale skin from which many of their veins and sometimes even organs can be seen through, and unnaturally spindly and ill-proportioned limbs. Their eyes retain multiple colors not seen in other humans as well, including reds, purples, whites and blacks.

While looking similar to humans, they possessed long pointed ears, alien yet exceptionally striking facial features, and shades of skin going from ivory to black to blue.\n\nThe Aelfir's greatest flaw was in their cruelty.

After humanity stole their magic and wiped out the race, they have been almost completely forgotten from history. The closest to memory of the Aelfir is from the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E] who worship a pantheon of 'First Men', and the Sjalvolki whose tales of [Concept('creature','Creatures')|E] from the 'Gods Above' contain mentions to Aelfir, though they are considred minor demons and little more than monsters."

At higher levels of exposure it can manifest in the bleeding of the eyes and nose, vomiting of blood, hair and skin loss, and the sloughing of skin.

The disease is generally agreed to be magical in nature, though its origins are unknown.

In [chevalie|E], the first High King in a generation along with his entire extended family were wiped out and the Chevaliens forced to withdraw from their last colonies in the Black Mountains. In Aversaria, an entire generation of the nobility were destroyed, leading to mass societal collapse and a near dissolution of the Aautokrata. In Sarradon, the structured and elite magic class, the Sirhad, were almost entirely destroyed.

An exceptionally complicated spell, Self-Replicating Blood Magic is only castable by the most powerful of [magi|E] and normally requires numerous others to assist them.\n\nThe spell detonates the target in a massive pillar of flame, and quickly does the same to anyone within the blast radius and beyond, spreading even further to Magi or others with magical properties. While theoretically it can be contained to a specific radius or group, the spell is extremely difficult to control, and there has never been cast in recorded history without the caster rapidly losing control.\n\nThe spell was thought lost after its discovery and use by the competing [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] Qurati and Almadi Magi cabals, who wiped themselves and nearly all of the continent's Magi out in the blast and brought anarchy across Sarradon for nearly a century after. It was later discovered by Legon-Aautokratir Aeschraes and Aautokratia Axiaothea during the [Concept('imperial_civil_war','Aversarian Civil War')|E]. While both prepared to cast it, only Aeschraes managed to in time, and ended up killing 80% of Aversaria's Magi, nearly half of the population otherwise, and wiped out millions otherwise across the entirety of the world. The pure magical power of the spell and the suffering it caused would open [the_rift|E] and bring forth [frodbrokna|E]."

 game_concept_shadesoul_curse_desc:89 "The Shadesoul Curse is an arcane disease that transforms its victim into an immortal, malignant Void-aligned being commonly known as a Blackspawn. Though it manifests in a whole sleuth of symptoms over time, the earliest and most universal one is an affliction with dreams that the Blackspawn feels an almost irresistible urge to enact in the waking world — dreams that are almost invariably destructive in nature.\n\nThe curse is the result of a shade possession that, for reasons unknown, does not kill the victim but seemingly fuses with or replaces their soul; children seemingly being much more susceptible to this. Very rare in most of Aeras, its highest concentration of bearers is in the ranks of the Redland cults, where it is intentionally given to newly-recruited initiates."

 #GAME TYPES
 
 game_concept_skittish_game:0 "Skittish Game"
 game_concept_skittish:0 "Skittish"
 game_concept_skittish_uppercase:0 "SKITTISH"
 game_concept_skittish_game_desc:0 "Skittish creatures are easily scared and will flee at the first sign of trouble. Though this means they are nearly completely safe and will not fight back if attacked, they are more difficult to hunt down due to their constantly high alertness. They will also never start ambushes."
 
 game_concept_cautious_game:0 "Cautious Game"
 game_concept_cautious:0 "Cautious"
 game_concept_cautious_uppercase:0 "CAUTIOUS"
 game_concept_cautious_game_desc:0 "Cautious game is more acutely concerned with self-preservation than most, and will usually avoid fights unless cornered. Though they might retaliate if given no other out, they will rarely bother to finish a fight, even if it is going in their favor, and instead merely make their escape as soon as possible. They will almost never start ambushes, unless as pre-emptive self defense in rare cases."
 
 game_concept_aggressive_game:0 "Aggressive Game"
 game_concept_aggressive:0 "Aggressive"
 game_concept_aggressive_uppercase:0 "AGGRESSIVE"
 game_concept_aggressive_game_desc:0 "Aggressive creatures have a vested interest in winning a fight once one is started, and will actively start combat with other creatures - either due to predation or intense territoriality. Though possible to scare off if sufficiently wounded, they will not back down easily."
 
 game_concept_unyielding_game:0 "Unyielding Game"
 game_concept_unyielding:0 "Unyielding"
 game_concept_unyielding_uppercase:0 "UNYIELDING"
 game_concept_unyielding_game_desc:0 "Either due to a complete lack of self-preservation instincts, extreme arrogance, or simply the actual inability to flee, unyielding creatures will never try to flee a fight. Though this means that there is no risk of one escaping once tracked down, it also means that the ensuing fight will always be to the death."
 
 game_concept_sedentary_game:0 "Sedentary Game"
 game_concept_sedentary:0 "Sedentary"
 game_concept_sedentary_uppercase:0 "SEDENTARY"
 game_concept_sedentary_game_desc:0 "Sedentary creatures practically never leave a small territory that they consider home. Though this means that they are unlikely to chase after attackers after they retreat, it also makes it significantly harder to track them."
 
 game_concept_fast_game:0 "Fast Game"
 game_concept_fast:0 "Fast"
 game_concept_fast_uppercase:0 "FAST"
 game_concept_fast_game_desc:0 "Fast creatures are capable of notable agility and speed, and are hence more likely to be able to flee once push comes to shove - and are nearly impossible to escape from if they are aggravated. Additionally, due to the vast distances they can usually travel, tracking them takes longer than normal."
 
 game_concept_slow_game:0 "Slow Game"
 game_concept_slow:0 "Slow"
 game_concept_slow_uppercase:0 "SLOW"
 game_concept_slow_game_desc:0 "Some creatures are especially slow or even outright immobile, and hence have a vastly more difficult time making an escape, and cannot pursue their enemies. However, this usually indicates that they have other ways to defend themselves from predation."
 
 game_concept_intelligent_game:0 "Intelligent Game"
 game_concept_intelligent:0 "Intelligent"
 game_concept_intelligent_uppercase:0 "INTELLIGENT"
 game_concept_intelligent_game_desc:0 "Some creatures go well beyond being merely intelligent for an animal, and are simply intelligent - period. They are very possibly sapient and at the intellectual level of a human, or in rare cases, perhaps even higher. Some may even be capable of speech, if they have any interest in dialogue.\n\nWhat this means in practise is that the game is exceptionally difficult to ambush, is far more proficient at ambushing itself, and is far more likely to retreat if it is at a disadvantage compared to the hunter."
 
 game_concept_cunning_game:0 "Cunning Game"
 game_concept_cunning:0 "Cunning"
 game_concept_cunning_uppercase:0 "CUNNING"
 game_concept_cunning_game_desc:0 "Cunning creatures possess remarkable wit and forethrought, and are more difficult to deceive than the average beast. This means that they are far harder to successfully ambush, are more adept at pulling off ambushes themselves, and will actively take into account the strength of a potential hunter when determining whether to fight or flee."
 
 game_concept_stupid_game:0 "Stupid Game"
 game_concept_stupid:0 "Stupid"
 game_concept_stupid_uppercase:0 "STUPID"
 game_concept_stupid_game_desc:0 "Some creatures are exceptionally dim-witted and naive, even for a wild beast. They will blunder into ambushes blissfully unaware, and are incapable of ambushing themselves."
 
 game_concept_huge_game:0 "Huge Game"
 game_concept_huge:0 "Huge"
 game_concept_huge_uppercase:0 "HUGE"
 game_concept_huge_game_desc:0 "Huge game towers over humans, and is likely able to kill with a well placed stomp if need be - presuming they are able to do so, of course. Even if not overtly aggressive, creatures of this size are formidable, but this also means that they are vastly easier to track than normal. Elephants are a good example of game in this category."
 
 game_concept_large_game:0 "Large Game"
 game_concept_large:0 "Large"
 game_concept_large_uppercase:0 "LARGE"
 game_concept_large_game_desc:0 "Large creatures are those that are significantly larger and more massive than the average human, but not to a point where they could be considered truly huge. Bears are a good example of a mundane animal of this size category. Large game is easier to track, but is also usually more formidable in combat."
 
 game_concept_elusive_game:0 "Elusive Game"
 game_concept_elusive:0 "Elusive"
 game_concept_elusive_uppercase:0 "ELUSIVE"
 game_concept_elusive_game_desc:0 "Elusive creatures are not only rare, but difficult to track - their trail can seemingly vanish into nothing in a matter of moments, either as a result of generally leaving little in the way of evidence of their activity, or due to their movement being highly erratic and unpredictable."
 
 game_concept_brazen_game:0 "Brazen Game"
 game_concept_brazen:0 "Brazen"
 game_concept_brazen_uppercase:0 "BRAZEN"
 game_concept_brazen_game_desc:0 "Brazen creatures navigate their environment with utter carelessness and make no effort to conceal their presence. The trails they leave behind are so obvious that even the most novice of hunters can track them with ease."
 
 game_concept_poisonous_game:0 "Poisonous Game"
 game_concept_poisonous:0 "Poisonous"
 game_concept_poisonous_uppercase:0 "POISONOUS"
 game_concept_poisonous_game_desc:0 "Some creatures are able to inflict poisons well beyond what the average human can conceivably survive. They are especially dangerous to hunt, as even what initially seems like a superficial flesh wound can end up killing in a matter of minutes as poison consumes the hapless victim's body."
 
 game_concept_social_game:0 "Social Game"
 game_concept_social:0 "Social"
 game_concept_social_uppercase:0 "SOCIAL"
 game_concept_social_game_desc:0 "Social creatures tend to live in groups, making them generally easier to track at the cost of combat being far more risky - if they are not ambushed, there is a chance that the hunter will be pursued at the conclusion of a fight, regardless of success. [Concept('skittish_game','Skittish')|E] creatures will never pursue, and [Concept('cautious_game','Cautious')|E] will only pursue if [Concept( 'intelligent_game', 'Intelligent' )|E] to retaliate in the event of one of their own being killed."
 
 game_concept_emanates_magic_game:0 "Magic-Emanating Game"
 game_concept_emanates_magic:0 "Emanates [magic|E]"
 game_concept_emanates_magic_uppercase:0 "EMANATES MAGIC"
 game_concept_emanates_magic_game_desc:0 "Some creatures emanate dangerous amounts of ambient [magic|E] into their surroundings. Though this means they are almost trivial to track for [magi|E], scaling with their skill, it also means that there is a reasonable risk of [exposure_sickness|E] when fighting one." 
 
 game_concept_moonbound_game:0 "Aervalr-Bound Game"
 game_concept_moonbound:0 "Aervalr-Bound"
 game_concept_moonbound_uppercase:0 "AERVALR-BOUND"
 game_concept_moonbound_game_desc:0 "The phases of [aervalr|E] are a potent source of [dead_magic|E] across the world, and it is unsurprising that some creatures' strength waxes and wanes together with [aeras|E]' moon. When the moon is dim, these creatures are more likely to be reclusive and weaker, while conversely being more aggressive and stronger when Aervalr shines bright."

 game_concept_merit:0 "Merit"
 game_concept_merit_desc:0 "The [marchers|E], though ostensibly ruled by feudal aristocrats, are rarely keen to follow those deemed unfit to rule. Historically, those exceptionally skilled in the arts of warfare and politics were often able to displace elder heirs from the line of succession and take the throne from themselves, especially if the heir in question was weak. If a High King has no worthy heirs, or on the contrary, an abundance of children in close contention, [chevalie|E] is likely to fragment, as was the case countless times in its past."

In the Ēboheph-Ölgon (White Ölgon) mythology, the god Arlikhaan was slain by the jealous goddess Aru-men, who desired to usurp the throne of Ēboheph-Ölgon. As he descended to [aeras|E] however, Arlikhaan fought Aru-men and her five thousand demon-spirits, subduing them and banishing her to the Mountain of Pain. Due to this, the Ebohephai do not hate the land; instead considering it sacred and burying their people in a type of burial mound known as Kurgans. They give worship to Arlikhaan and his five thousand demon-spirits and one hundred fire gods. His brother, Kogonhay, was given dominion of all under the sky and from him issued forth the race of man."

In the Pantheon of Death, the souls of the other divines remain trapped after their apparent death, and their will can only be known through Daramarjaratan, the interpreter of the dead. Thus, Daramarjaratan is in essense a regent for the throne of the gods, and all claimed interactions with them are actually through Daramarjaratan relaying their messages at her own leisure."

While most Avastya Mahani choose one or a handful of gods to focus their worship upon, many cults to specific deities have split from the faith and formed their own offshoot faiths (especially after Kashirya's conquest by Otached's [iorne_horde|E]) such as Saravarawat, god of knowledge whose followers formed Vidvaookeyatranism; and Karhikala, god of war, death and justice whose followers would form Karitkamaicism"

 game_concept_varodist_creation_myth_desc:0 "Varodaists believe that the creation of the world was done through the shifting of water that slowly carved land from rock, and that the holy oceans and seas can portray prophecies within the movement of their waves. They see time as cyclical, believing that the world is in an unending series of being consumed by the sea and destroyed, only for the seas to recede and for the sea creatures to once again wander onto land to repopulate the reformed land.\n\nVarodaists also worship Varoda's children, the aquatic creatures of the sea which they maintain all land creatures descended from; ancient beasts slowly walking on land and shedding their scales."

 game_concept_armazli_mountains:0 "Armazli Mountains"
 game_concept_armazli_mountains_desc:0 "The Arnazni faithful believe that the Armazli Mountains that protect them from the northern barbarians were made by their ancestors who held godlike magical powers; however, as time went on, these beings started to lose their might due to becoming content and soft. An exception to this were the three brothers; [arnaz_azot_zalden|E]. Disgusted by their peers' new habits, the three of them made a new mountain. Arnaz, being eldest and wisest, was crowned High king. After Parnaz slew Azot in a duel for the high kingship, the  great mountain where his father was crowned would be renamed in his honor, and no foul man or beast may step foot on it."

Disgusted by the increasingly lax and content nature of their fellow peers', the three set out to build a new mountain. Arnaz the Eldest and Wisest was crowned High King and set out on a conquest to unify the land. However, during the wars, his brother Azot became jealous at his success and betrayed him, slaying Arnaz and claiming his throne for himself. Before his death, however, Arnaz cursed everyone leading to a great reduction in magical capabilities. Furthermore, Arnaz proclaimed that his son would kill Azot and reclaim the high kingship\n\nAnd so it was that after many years, a young man named Parnaz, with aid from Zalden, would slay Azot in a duel and reclaim the throne. The great mountain on which his father was crowned would be renamed in his honor, and no foul man or beast may step foot on it. Parnaz would reign for many centuries, and many in Amaghea today would be related to him."
 game_concept_xaxbaxakanax_esotericism:0 "Xaxbaxakanax Esotericism"
 game_concept_xaxbaxakanax_esotericism_desc:0 "Due to their exceptionally simple set of beliefs compared to other contemporaries, many find their faith extremely esoteric. As such, it is believed(by the Aversarians at least) to be most likely caused by them having been exceptionally primitive and disparate when their few historical realms were consumed by their neighbors. Very few realms have held power over them.\n\nAnd so, when their homelands were conquered by the Aversarians, they saw it as just yet another in a series of petty despots that would always come and always go, and as such, the faithful largely avoided harsh treatment by being too minor to achieve notice"
 game_concept_evil_lore:0 "Evil Lore"
 game_concept_evil_lore_desc:0 "Askevaryaans describe 'Evil Lore' as the knowledge that entered the world against Sarvat's wishes thanks to the efforts of evil demons and gods. To please Sarvat's wishes and ensure that the world is as they wished, 'Evil Lore' is to be destroyed and wiped out. This has naturally led to Askevaryaans regularly burning down libraries across Kashirya in an attempt to erase remnants of ancient and dark rituals."
