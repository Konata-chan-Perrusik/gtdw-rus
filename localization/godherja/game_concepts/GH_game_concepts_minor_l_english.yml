Over a period of years, the 'Thousand Days' would see the city face devastating floods, the collapse of the ruins that the lower city had been constructed upon in an earthquake, the unearthing of a hive of creatures known as the 'Ykian' from an ancient temple beneath the Governorial Palace, and more.\n\nThe collapse would culminate in the [imperial_civil_war|E] where mass bread riots and a horrific plague epidemic were answered by Aautokratia Axiaothea with the extermination of much of the populace. The city was already largely a wasteland by the time [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] finally wiped the remains from [aeras|E]."
