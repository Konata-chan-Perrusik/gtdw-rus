 game_concept_ufaliracci:0 "Ufaliracci"
 game_concept_ufaliracci_desc:0 "Ufaliracci was a [Concept('ritualism','Ritualist')|E] kingdom originally founded by traders, exiles, & seafarers migrating from the Horn of [sarradon|E] and further west, escaping the [war_in_heaven|E]. It would grow to dominate the [pirate_coast|E] from the 6th century until their complete destruction during the [siege_of_ufaliracci|E]. Ufaliracci would grow from a minor city state to control the flow of trade at the crossroads of [aversaria|E], Kathun-Kai, southern Sarradon, and [kashirya|E]. Their power waned with the start of the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] to the north while the rising of powerful pirates and trading coalitions across the region—such as the [cinnamon_cities|E], [gavan_coalition|E], and [magaala_qaaday|E]—challenged the Ritualist monarchs for supremacy."
 game_concept_siege_of_ufaliracci:0 "Siege of Ufaliracci"
 game_concept_siege_of_ufaliracci_desc:0 "The Siege of Ufaliracci, commonly known as the 'Blood Silver Assault,' was a 50 day siege on the capital city of [ufaliracci|E] early in the 11th Century. Following decades of decay and corruption, the lost control over the [cinnamon_cities|E]' shipping lanes, as well as the catastrophic fallout of the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] to the north, the Kingdom of Ufaliracci held control over little beyond their capital island. Powerful pirates had wrought havoc across the coast for years, though none compared to the might of [gavan_coalition|E]. Captain Gavan "Iron Eye" had long set sight on the [silver_palace|E], and in 1010, brought the full force of his fleet to bare on the Ufaliracci capital. The mighty walls of the city held for 48 days before Iron Eye's Magi cracked the very earth just to bring them down. The Iron Eye pirates would face harsh and bloody resistance on their path to the palace, though the raiders would burn and pillage everything in their path.\n\nOnce Iron Eye reached the palace on the 50th day of his siege, his forces had been reduced to dozens, and the surrounding city lay in ruin.\n\nThe royal family took up arms alongside the guards and servants to beat back the pirates. It is said that once Gavan finally reached the throne after slaughtering the royal family, the only one still left was the boy Prince who stood before the throne clutching a knife. No record of the boy survives, but stories tell of the boy carving out Gavan's eyes and feeding them to him as his crew watched. The Gavan Coalition would fracture in civil war after the Siege of Ufaliracci, leaving a power vacuum in the coast. As minor pirates and petty lords clashed over the scattered isolas, the century would end with the arrival of the earliest Marine Legions from [aversaria|E] in western Rovarska and the height of the [cinnamon_cities|E] power."
 game_concept_cinnamon_cities:0 "Cinnamon Cities"
 game_concept_cinnamon_cities_desc:0 "The Cinnamon Cities were a coalition of city—states that controlled spice trade throughout the [pirate_coast|E] between the 11th and 13th centuries following the [siege_of_ufaliracci|E]. Built off the financing and investments of several powerful merchants, as well as Kattupu Jamyras in his construction of the [silver_palace|E], the Cinnamon Cities would aggressively expand and take control of most spice trade coming through the Pirate Coast. Leveraging hefty bribes and plentiful loans, these cities even surpassed [ufaliracci|E] in wealth. It would not be until the [imperial_civil_war||E] when trade dried from the west that the Cities lost control of their vast plantations in the face of [wind_blades_rebellion|E] and the [five_captains_war|E]."
 game_concept_magaala_qaaday:0 "Magaala Qaaday"
 game_concept_magaala_qaaday_desc:0 "Magaala Qaaday is a great metropolis built on the tip of the Horn of [sarradon|E]. The thin black soil of the Horn has long been known to flood to such an extent that a man can drown walking down the coast. It is said that the local Dadkawji merchants and architects, with the help of the great spindle-leg crabs of the nearby Siltwalker tribes, raised the original walled settlement above the ocean's high tide. The city would continue to expand, ultimately growing to be one of the most important ports in the [pirate_coast|E], occasionally called the 'Capital of Dye.'"
 game_concept_gavan_coalition:0 "Gavan Coalition"
 game_concept_gavan_coalition_desc:0 "The Gavan Coalition was a Pirate Armada that briefly held complete control over the [pirate_coast|E] at the beginning of the 11th Century. Lead by Captain Gavan "Iron Eye," the Gavan Coalition at its height would consist of over 90 ships and 8,000 pirates. They brutally enacted tolls and raids across the seas for nearly 10 years before their complete collapse following Iron Eye's death during the [siege_of_ufaliracci|E]."
 game_concept_five_captains_war:0 "Five Captains War"
 game_concept_five_captains_war_desc:0 "The Five Captains War is the name given for a series of minor conflicts and skirmishes that embroiled the [pirate_coast|E] throughout the 12th & 13th Centuries. Beginning with either [wind_blades_rebellion|E] in 1193 or the assassination of Adritti "Wildfire" in 1195, the conflicts would see dozens of pirates rise and fall throughout the struggle. The five captains at the top of this clash for supremacy—Ginting "Wind-Blade," Deparii "The Sick Rat," Toba "Blackrock," Sitepu "Emptyheart," and "Burning Star" Amittravalli—would leave their mark on the region for decades to come. The Five Captains War would end with the founding of the Haytrapatni of Peytrelles in the Night Coast, and the deaths of Captains "Emptyheart" and "Wind-Blade" at the hands of "Burning Star" Amittravalli."
 game_concept_wind_blades_rebellion:0 "Wind-Blade's Rebellion"
 game_concept_wind_blades_rebellion_desc:0 "Wind-Blades's Rebellion was a series of slave revolts led by Ginting Wind-Blade throughout the vast plantations controlled by the [cinnamon_cities|E]. Ginting, originally a slave blinded by his master as a child and left for dead, executed his former master and a number of plantation owners from the surrounding hills after releasing hundreds of slaves while the nobility partook in a wedding. The city states would attempt to quell the uprising unsuccessfully, even requesting the assistance of the nearby Legio XCV 'Viesuados,' but their combined forces would be wiped out on 3.1.1200 attempting to launch a surprise attack on Wind-Blade's forces. The chaos that followed [frodbrokna|E] would all but dismantle the Cinnamon Cities power structure, leaving many of its leaders dead or bankrupt."
 game_concept_silver_palace:0 "Silver Palace"
 game_concept_silver_palace_desc:0 "The Silver Palace was originally built by the great smith and poet, Kattupu Jamyras, 9th Monarch of the [ufaliracci|E] Kingdom. It is said that the palace took 30 years to build, and the shear expense of its construction would forever cement the [cinnamon_cities|E] trading power throughout the region. It has long since been stripped of its valuables, and is now little more than ruin on an empty hill."
 game_concept_pirate_coast:0 "Pirate Coast"
 game_concept_pirate_coast_desc:0 "The Pirate Coast is a large, tropical archipelago that straddles the Horn of [sarradon|E] and Southern [kashirya|E]. The Region has long passed back and forth between the control of powerful merchants and pirates seeking to control the riches that pass through the region coming from [aversaria|E], Kathun-Kai, Kashirya, and the rest of Sarradon. Some polities in the region's history, such as [ufaliracci|E] or the [cinnamon_cities|E], left long lasting legacies upon the region."
 game_concept_high_tide:0 "High Tide"
 game_concept_high_tide_desc:0 "The tidal waves on the Horn of [sarradon|E] are known to be strong enough to submerge vast regions of the coast deep enough to drown a man. When the tide recedes, this is known as [low_tide|E]. Counties will produce more [income|E], and have greater [advantage|E], at the cost of [building|E] Construction Time and [supply|E]."
 game_concept_low_tide:0 "Low Tide"
 game_concept_low_tide_desc:0 "The charcoal sands of the Horn of [sarradon|E] are in stark contrast to the blue waters of the [pirate_coast|E]. Low Tide [counties|E] produce less [income|E] and have lower [advantage|E], but quicker [building|E] Construction Time and greater [supply|E]."
