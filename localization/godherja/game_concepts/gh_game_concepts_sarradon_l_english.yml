 game_concept_mubaaizun_desc:0 "A mubaaizun is a champion of a [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] army; often the best warriors of a lord will participate in a ritual duel before the battle commences, fighting to the death. These duels are often accompanied with each army chanting or insulting one another, and there have been instances - such as the [battle_of_the_mubaaizun|E] - where multiple duels happen before battle commences, often to avenge a dead mubaaizun.\n\nIt is permissible to flee a duel if a mubaaizun knows he's lost, and the other mubaaizun can only chase him so far before having to retreat. These duels can have a tremendous impact on an army's morale, and some battles have been averted entirely because of a lost duel. Anyone capable of fighting can be a mubaaizun, and there are a few commanders in history that have been their own champions. Mubaaizun are traditionally not [magi|E], and are usually swordsmen clad in personalized and resplendent armor.\n\nMubaaizun duels have fallen out of favor ever since the arrival of the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E]; most Aversarian commanders are wholly disinterested in appointing mubaaizun or in participating in the customs of [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonians')|E], though there are a few exceptions."

 game_concept_tarshaf:0 "Tarshaf Glasswork"
 game_concept_tarshaf_glasswork_fix_desc:0 "A catchall term for a wide variety of [magi|E]-crafted glassware endemic to Sarradon, first taking hold sometime around the 10th century IS. These came in various shapes and fulfilled various functions, with the original pioneers of the technique producing telescopes capable of astounding levels of precision. Other uses would be developed in the century that followed, with mirrors capable of limited redirecting of magic and nearly unbreakable panes of glass finding their way into the houses of the rich and powerful across Sarradon. At the port city of Fitokon the inventor Ishef b. Ubays even set up an experimental harbor defense, which took the form of an array of mirrors and prisms capable of redirecting the suns rays to set ships ablaze.\n\nThe pinnacle of the art arrived with the Ibriti Cabal's discovery of a way to use the structure of a precisely crafted Tarshaf Glass prism to perfectly store magical energy. They promptly used it to entrap a notoriously powerful local Djinn known as "A'Arbala" - the Widow. With the mighty Wind-Djinn now able to be easily transported and unleashed at will, the Ritualist Ibriti proceeded to slaughter all of their rival cabals, and threw their weight behind the short-lived attempted hegemony of Ritualist Warlord Bulas Al Kuddhur.  \n\nThe Ibriti Cabal fell apart at the seams a few years afer Bulas' death by poison, with the roughly twenty surviving members of its inner circle scattering across Eastern Sarradon. In the years to come the secrets of crafting Tarshaf Prisms would disseminate across the region's Magi Cabals and Warlords.\n\nThe art would achieve infamy during the Qassaride Wars, as Efreeti and Djinni were used to scour large parts of Eastern Sarradon by the Zindariq Warlords. Since their defeat by a desperate coalition of Mamurite Wardenites, Traditionalist Wardenite, and Ritualists, the secrets to crafting Tarshaf prisms have been effectively lost due both to suppression by authorities and the death of many of its masters. The stigma has even caused less dangerous examples of Tarshaf glasswork to be viewed with suspicion and hostility."
 
 game_concept_djinn:0 "Djinn"
 game_concept_djinn_desc:0 "Djinn are ethereal creatures which can be found all across Aeras, but are found in particular numbers in Sarradon - though it is rumored that some regions in the [Concept('the_continent','Continental')|E] Steppe also play host to substantial numbers of these strange entities as well. Under normal circumstances, Djinn are not a threat to non-[magi|E] as they are usually only capable of exerting enough force to move small objects. In many Sarradonian cultures it is common to blame these enigmatic and invisible spirits for misplaced or stolen items. It is only when given access to magical energy that they can become truly dangerous, for they are able to grow in power and substantiality the more of it they are exposed to. Ley lines, and especially ley line intersections are particularly dangerous places to encounter a Djinni, and most magi working in such areas have taken substantial precautions to prevent wild Djinn from causing havoc.\n\nDjinn are apparently sentient, and can be bargained with. Their sensitivity to magic also means that Magi with the right skills can, with some effort, bind them to their will using brute magical force. While Djinn are nearly immortal, and most of them have likely existed for countless millennia, their memories fade relatively quickly. Even the most lucid seem to be unable to hold information for longer than a century, and most are limited to substantially less than that. Worse, as their memories fade, their personalities can shift quite radically. Many Magi have met their end when they discovered that a Djinn listed in a grimoire as friendly and affable has turned murderous in the years since their description was authored."

The Erimatos are a blend of these locals, colonists from Aversaria proper, and native Sarradonian peoples from whom numerous customs and practices have been taken. Several centuries and an entire sea separating them from mainland Aversaria have resulted in them speaking a dialect nearly unintelligible by their continental brethren, and intermarriage with locals means that even their appearance is subtly distinct from them as well. While they are still Aversarian, they represent a strange fusion of foreign customs and blood that set them apart from most of their cultural kin."

Different versions of the Marmalid Demigod list also exist, with some tribes claiming descent to an unrecognized child of Marmal.

 game_concept_marmaladid_invasions_desc:0 "The unexpected emergence of the Marmaladid people from the deep Sarradonian Desert in the early 11th century heralded an unprecedented wave of nomadic encroachment into the settled coastal lands of Sarradon. Riding strange beasts and commanding otherworldly magics and demons from the deepest desert, they were a source of terror amongst their foes for nearly a century. While the traditional Wardenite powers of the West and Center would weather the storm and shatter the invaders, the politically disunified lands of Eastern Sarradon would rapidly fall under Marmaladid rule as they swept all before them, subjugating lands to the shore of the Sea of Empires itself in fulfillment of a great and ancient prophecy among their people.\n\nThe Aftires (Over Kings) of the Marmaladids who led these invasions were the demigod children of the divine progenitor and namesake of the Marmaladids, and were said to be warlords of great and fearful magical power the likes of which has never been seen before or since. Throughout the course of the 11th and 12th centuries they were variously were slain in battle or ascended into the heavens, and to this day all are subject to folk worship among the Marmaladids alongside more recently adopted Sarradonian cults and faiths.\n\nMarmaladid unity in the conquered eastern lands would not last. Infighting amongst the lower kings and the withdrawal of the divine Djunhat into the desert never to return would see the short-lived realm of Great Tarrafent (Dreamt of Ocean) shatter in only 32 years. It would see reunification under the warlord Ozalces, a Sophocist convert and grandson of Dawas herself, and functioned for a few generations as a Marmaladid Ritualist kingdom before collapsing due to kinstrife."

Gawold, Qabilat Saalma, and En Msuffiyyun were sacked viciously and much of the population driven into the wilds, slain, or taken into captivity never to be seen again.\n\nThe nomads would retreat back into the desert, but returned in 1015 to raid even deeper into the Mamuramat. For the next 30 years the Mamuramat would struggle mightily to resist their raids. Though El Qulatha and its environs remained inviolate, the nomads raided daringly, occupying or forcing into submission territories ranging all the way to the Tasuri’a Gulf. Even the Regency of Kharadun was forced to pay humiliating tribute of silver.\n\nThe nomads were unstoppable because they were led by a warlord of great magical power known as Mutsar, said to have been a giant who stood thirty feet tall and to have a voice that could cause earthquakes and landslides. Wherever he went no Tathtalite army could withstand him. Worse, his many sons and daughters were all giants like him, and their strength tested the mettle of the bravest of the Wardenites, slaying many heroes. Mutarshid’s advisors and heirs squabbled endlessly over how to defeat them and free Sihnimiyyah from the nomad’s occupation.\n\nFinally it was Musta’sim, Mutarshid’s often overlooked and bookish son, who proposed to rouse the Magi-Engineers of El Qulatha’s many colleges to wrest control of the quaking earth back from the giant and his kin. At first his father’s advisors dismissed his idea as a joke, for nobody had thought to use the bookish mages of the School of Manifestations’ skill in the Stone Arcana for such martial pursuits. When most of his detractors were slain during the Landslide Ambush Tragedy of 1045, the few wise men remaining in the court gave in to Musta’sim’s plans. \n\nThis culminated in the Battle of the Shrieking Earth in 1047, where the nomads and their false god was swallowed by the earth, their power overcome by a choir of magi conscripted from the colleges of Manifestations of El Qulatha, though at great cost."

 game_concept_war_in_heaven_desc:0 "The War in Heaven was the brutal near-1000 years of conflict between the [Concept('wardenism','Wardenites')|E] and [Concept('ritualism','Ritualists')|E] from 296 IS with the rise of The First Warden to 1237 IS with the fall of the last independent Ritualist ruler. While the war contained dozens of various sides of many different faiths that would rise and fall on behalf of one of the sides (or both or neither), the main conflict always surrounded the warlords of the Ritualist and Wardenite faiths.\n\nThe war was extremely bitter and brought widespread devastation to [sarradon|E]. While the continent had several high points during the midst of the conflict, it was always soon ended by a continuation of warfare. The use of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] by the competing Qurati and the Almadi [magi|E] Cabals led to seemingly the end of Sarradonian prosperity, wiping out 80% of the Magi population and millions otherwise.\n\nThe 'war' (which was actually dozens of smaller conflicts over the time period), began to end with the arrival of Agionist, [Concept('marchers','Chevalien')|E] and [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] merchants and mercenaries from [Concept('the_continent','Greater Aversaria')|E] in 1144 IS. The northerners initially opened up several trade posts and brought new life to a continent still recovering from the destruction of Self-Replicating Blood Magic. Initially, they simply bought more and more land, but then began greatly expanding their reach by outright taking land from the Sarradonians. The war officially ended in 1233 IS with the Siege of Qarmuz, the last free castle of the Ritualist faith in Sarradon. While the following (and partially concurrent) [saints_war|E] is sometimes considered a continuation of the war, most Sarradonian scholars see it as a separate and new conflict."

Slaying each of them, Fihr cut off their heads and demanded that more combatants step forward, and despite the injuries he suffered during the duels, no one else challenged him.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the duels, Khuzaima's forces charged the Wardenites and nearly routed them, though the bannerman Ghalib managed to rally the Wardenites. This rally was short lived when Khuzaima and his retinue routed the enemy cavalry, turning around and attacking the Wardenite rear. In the ensuing tumult, Khuzaima was thrown from his horse and broke his leg, but Wardenite forces were routed and suffered high casualties.\n\nThe battle has since gone on to be one of the most famous in [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] history, mainly because of the unusually large number of duels between Mubaaizun, leading to both [Concept('ritualism','Ritualists')|E] and Wardenites romanticizing it.

Shielded by the Tarsanide Mountains, the polity would rapidly become a refuge for a number of Sarradonian high nobles, fleeing from the advancing tide of the [great_uprising|E].\n\nDespite its lofty claims, the Regency would spend most of its history struggling to reign in even the territories it notionally held, with the Regency itself effectively reduced to a pawn in a region dominated by warlords. Nonetheless, several attempted Wardenite invasions would be staved off, either by the united armies of the realm or the walls of Qarmuz themselves.\n\nFollowing the surrender of Qarmuz to Hanathi in 985 IS, the state was renamed the 'Empire of Sarradon'—A heretofore unprecedented title—marking the beginning both of an age of centralization and of conquest. Despite general success against foes both internal and external, the fallout of these reforms and wars would tear the state asunder over the course of the 11th century IS, during which the Mamurs would begin their final march towards the destruction of the Regency.

 game_concept_sirhad:0 "Sirhad"
 game_concept_sirhad_desc:0 "A lost relic from the time before the Halakdun, the Sirhad were a highly organized caste of Magi whose power and influence were entrenched throughout central and eastern Sarradon. Their origins were nearly mythical - lost in the depths of Sarradon's early history and likely predating Ritualism itself. Any Sarradonian who showed magical potential would be inducted into their ranks - sometimes against their will, as the Sirhad believed that unregulated Magi posed a threat to Sarradonian society and to the authority of the Sirhad as a whole. As marriages within the Sirhad were heavily encouraged, Sarradon became home to a large number of very potent magical bloodlines whose lineages went back millennia. Intricate records of these bloodlines were kept in the Sirhad's greatest stronghold, now known only as The [sunken_house|E]. This magical citadel was kept hidden somewhere in the depths of the Khibkhibirin, protected from outsiders by devilishly complex wards and illusions.\n\nDuring the [war_in_heaven|E] the Sirhad remarkably remained neutral in the conflict. Although individual members were allowed to hold sympathies, the organization forbade any direct involvement or favoritism using the Sirhad's considerable resources. Any magi who participated in the war did so as an individual, and could count on no support from the senior leadership. Even more remarkably, this idealistic nonpartisanship seems to have actually worked quite effectively, and the Sirhad's services as middlemen and neutral negotiators became almost as invaluable as their services as magi."
 
 game_concept_mizfarun_dawl:0 "A'Mizfarun Dawl"
 game_concept_mizfarun_dawl_desc:0 "A clandestine cult operating cells within the [sirhad|E]'s broader structure, the Mizfarun Dawl operated across multiple cabals and regional caucuses throughout Sarradon. Through spying, targeted assassinations, and calculated atrocities they acted as the hidden dagger of the Sirhad, protecting its interests and avenging its defeats. More ominously, they were not above directing their attentions inwards, blackmailing or even murdering [sirhad|E] Magi who threatened to rock the boat. Rumored to have been followers of an exclusively practiced mystery cult whose rites are otherwise unknown, they put their considerable influence towards cementing the [sirhad|E]'s unity and neutrality in the midst of the ongoing [war_in_heaven|E].\n\nThe exact nature of their failure in this final task in the years leading up to the [Concept('the_decimation_of_sarradon','Halakdun')|E] is often pondered over by scholars interested in such esoteric topics. Most theories posit that the Mizfarun Dawl was itself finally overcome by the Wardenite-Ritualist factionalism, fracturing into competing orders of [magi|E] assassins. It is even theorized that these two newly splintered cults even had a hand in the [Concept('the_decimation_of_sarradon','Halakdun')|E] itself, with the rival factions aiding and abetting their respective coreligionist allies in the Almadi and Alqarati cabals. A small minority - mocked even in the fringe circles of scholars with an interest in the topic - wildly claim that the Mizfarun Dawl never splintered, and in fact had engineered the [Concept('the_decimation_of_sarradon','Halakdun')|E] and the continent spanning horror that followed for their own ends. Whether that was a genocidal attempt to bring a close to the [war_in_heaven|E] via mutual exhaustion of both parties, the side effects of an even more secret ritual meant to secure their ascension to a hitherto unknown spiritual plane, or something even more sinister still is something the doomsayers and conspiracists can never quite agree upon."

 game_concept_ishtabima_mamura:0 "Ishtabima Mamura"
 game_concept_ishtabima_mamura_desc:0 "Bodyguard, [magi|E], partisan of the would-be Mamura Sanad, and controversial saint, Ishtabima's historical origins are somewhat murky with alternate sources claiming her to have been a bastard-born niece of the Mamura, or even just a commoner who proved herself during the tumult of the Halakdun. Regardless, she demonstrated her martial and tactical prowess on multiple occasions while serving her mistress, rising to serve both as her foremost minister, and eventually as de facto commander on her armies. Indeed, some partisans of Ishtabima have gone so far as to claim that Sanad's defeat at the Battle of Azareq was due to her forsaking her general's advice in favor of the duplicitous conspiracy which saw her exiled from Sanad's war council. \n\n Tales of Isthabima's death and life are notoriously contradictory. Though she died at the relatively tender age of thirty-eight (or forty-five, or twenty-seven depending on whether one adheres to certain heterodox historical records) she had already built up a devoted following amongst partisans of Sanad, which has only grown since her death. Though she is renowned for a number of martial exploits (the Envelopment at the Brooks and the Two-ringed Fort by which she won the siege of Tishwarada (which dashed for good the ambitions of the Ritualist Prophet Mannahawaswa), her most famous action is known today as the Righteous Stand. There at the lone bridge crossing the rive A'Authia she is said to have slain no less than a thousand soldiers and Magi in a desperate attempt to protect Sanad's army as she retreated from the pursuing armies of the Wardenite pretender Abathis, fighting every spell and sword technique she knew. Exposure sickness accrued from the magic she wove that day, which boiled marrow and turned the very flesh of Abathis' pursuing soldiers to red ruin, is said to have contributed to her death a scant few months after. Those who hold her as a saint view this act of ultimate devotion as a kind of sacred martyrdom—not a useless or symbolic sacrifice, but a planned and strategically calculated suicide. It is said that as she was carried off that day her entire body glowed ochre with the [arcana|E] radiation of unspeakable energies, a final and fatal proof to her devotion to her cause and to her Mamura.\n\n To die, and to do so for devotion beyond the ability of any living mortal to name. To achieve a fate on [aeras|E] beyond this pale and fleeting world; is that not transcendent? So say her partisans among the Beshashuriyya at least. It is an unremarkably banal tragedy that she herself left not a single word to justify her actions, and to explain the cause at whose feet she willingly spilled her lifeblood. Did Sanad herself know?"

 game_concept_sunken_house:0 "Sunken House"
 game_concept_sunken_house_desc:0 "One of the Sirhad's most famous strongholds, the Sunken House was used to protect the group's most dangerous secrets and critical resources. It was considered completely impregnable, not just because of its ingenious wards and defenses, but because it was also secreted away deep in the desert. No surviving accounts exist giving even the barest hint of its location or appearance, for it is believed that the masters of the Sirhad had magically bound shades to the task of hunting down and devour any written works which accurately described the fortress.\n\nThe Sunken house also protected much of the Sirhad's records, and was critical to maintaining their strong cohesion. While only a select few would be given the keys to access it, through a series of now lost spells the keepers of this citadel were able to stay in constant communication with the rest of the Sirhad, no matter how distant they were.\n\nThe House was yet another casualty of the collapse of the Sirhad, though thanks to a carefully maintained quarantine it is believed to have remained untouched by the Bloodblight. Instead, in the three days before all contact was lost, members of the Sirhad record having received a series of increasingly panicked and disoriented communiques from their contacts within the citadel, warning them from attempting to enter and raving about a shadowy animalistic hunter referred to only as "the Beast".\n\nDespite this somewhat ominous conclusion to its known history, finding and looting the Sunken House has been a perennial favorite of treasure hunters, adventurers, exiles and common bandits everywhere throughout Sarradon and beyond. Despite their best and bravest efforts, no one has lain eyes upon the citadel in over half a millennia - or at least, no one has done so and returned to tell the tale."
 
 game_concept_disuwai:0 "The Metropolis of Disuwai"
 game_concept_disuwai_desc:0 "Founded by the Western [Concept('mamuramat','Mamur')|E] Maha in 542, Disuwai grew up as a trading port, its merchants filling their pockets with the wealth flowing from the trade with the Amsari and Kemsari in the far West. Even being sacked by the Ayyar wasn't enough to stop the city's growth. Nevertheless, the city would likely have gone down as a mere footnote were it not for the events which briefly saw it catapulted into the eye of the entire [Concept('wardenism','Wardenite')|E] world - The Kathsiti dissent.
