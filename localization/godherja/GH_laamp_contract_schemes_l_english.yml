 gh_laamp_base_contract_schemes.9012.desc: "After hours of tense discussion, the elders finally nod in agreement. They have accepted our terms, though not without extracting their pound of flesh. The host will be allowed to pass through their lands, but in return, we have promised them a share of grain and assurances that their people will be left unharmed.\n\nThe elders clasp my arm in a gesture of respect, their earlier hostility replaced by a grudging admiration. "You drive a hard bargain," one of them says, his voice tinged with both annoyance and approval.\n\nAs we leave the meeting, I feel a sense of relief. The host will march unhindered, but the Aversarians will not forget this agreement—and neither should you."

 gh_laamp_base_contract_schemes.9013.desc: "The negotiations have collapsed. Despite our best efforts, the Aversarian elders remain unmoved. Their demands were too great, their distrust too deep. As the talks break down, the atmosphere grows tense. The elders rise from their seats, their hands gripping their weapons.\n\n"You have wasted our time," one of them snarls. "Leave now, or you will not leave at all."\n\nYou retreat hastily, knowing that the host will not take this news well. The villagers have closed their land, and any attempt to pass through their lands will now be met with violence.\n\nAs we return to camp, I can't help but wonder if there was something we could have done differently. But for now, the only certainty is that blood will be spilled—and I will bear the weight of this defeat."
