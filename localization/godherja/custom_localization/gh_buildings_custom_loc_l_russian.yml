 old_walls_of_oraispol_desc:0 "The 'Old Walls' refer to a series of now mostly obsolete or outright ruined walls and defenceworks that criss-cross the historical heart of Oraispol, some dating as far back as the polis-era. Built, destroyed, rebuilt and modified countless of times throughout the city's history, the walls were ultimately determined to be woefully inadequate in the protection of [Concept('aversaria','Aversaria')|E]'s capital by Eramos in the 8th century — especially considering the fact that by then, they only protected the ancient nucleus of a city that has drastically grown in preceding centuries — and were replaced by the Aautokratir's own ambitious project.\n\nNowadays, most of the old complex is used either as a structural backbone to housing, storage, lodgings for the city guard, or the home of vagrants, but in an emergency it could still theoretically provide a final line of defense in especially desperate situations - for what little good it would do."

 eramasic_walls_name:0 "Eramasic Walls"
 eramasic_walls_desc:0 "Named after the 8th century Aautokratir that initially ordered their construction (but never lived to see them completed), the Eramasic Walls are a series of imposing stone walls that surround most of modern Oraispol. Unlike the old walls of the city, whose construction and reconstruction was a haphazzard affair that dragged out for over a thousand years, the Eramasic Walls were built with an initial, ambitious design in mind and only rarely fundamentally changed since then.\n\nPossessing numerous towers and heavily fortified gates, the walls would be breached only a handful of times throughout their history, most infamously when they would be left permanently damaged in Aeolus' bombardment of the city with fire magic in the [turmoil_of_the_sixteen_aautokratirs|E]."

 three_gates_of_oraispol_name:0 "The Three Gates"
 three_gates_of_oraispol_desc:0 "Though the Eramasic Walls have several dozen gates, three in particular stand out - the Flower Gate, the Dour Gate and the Vilnian Gate.\n\nThe so-called 'Flower Gate' (Pylos Anthemos) is the oldest of the three, built during the initial construction of the walls themselves, and is so named both for its colorful and highly ornamented appearance and the tradition of it being covered by flowers during springtime. The Dour Gate, on the other hand, stands as the exact opposite. Built during the reign of an Aautokratir that clearly valued practicality over any kind of aesthetics whatsoever, the gate is often described as an impregnable, blocky monstrosity that is at once both the strongest bulwark and biggest eyesore of the city's entire defense system.\n\nFinally, the Vilnian Gate is most notable for being the most busy thoroughfare of the entire city. Built specifically to allow for an immense volume of foot and horse traffic while still remaining defensive, it is also famous for being the site of the#E Vilnian Assault#! in 1229."

 02_champion_grounds_custom_loc_desc:0 "The Champion Grounds, or Protoshliti, is a great fortress where Legio XLII 'Pride of Aversaria' trained the most exceptional recruits of the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] State Legions. Those who are trained in the Protoshliti by its venerated instructors are likely to become champions themselves, and many of Aversaria's legendary heroes within the Legions would have their stories begin from inside its halls.\n\nAfter considerable sponsorship from [ROOT.Var('02_champion_grounds_namesake_var').GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName], the Protoshliti has been restored to its condition prior to its destruction by Aautokratir Aeschraes' forces. The vast training grounds have been cleared of debris, the great wall of the fortress has been repaired and reinforced, and enough quarters have been constructed so as to hold a maximum of three legions. While Legio XLII has long been consigned to history, many legion veterans remain, and the promise of gold and respite are enough to convince them to train the new generation of legionnaires." # GH TODO: Reintegrate champion_grounds_instructor custom loc in a non-buggy way
