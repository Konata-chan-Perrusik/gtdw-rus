 moonkin_flavor:0 "The Moonkin are followers of the Mondecny ways who have been blessed before the many faces of [aervalr|E]. Masters of all eight of the fighting styles, they are both a beautifully graceful and terrifyingly destructive sight on the battlefield.#!"

They come in a variety of forms, from small scuttling things to massive leviathans, all borne only from the deepest fears of the living and dead, past, present, and future....#!"
 whisperers_flavor:0 "The Whisperers are [fogeaters|E] blessed (or cursed) with the 'gift' of magic. Seemingly jabbering insane ruins of what were once men and women, they summon forth the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E] and unleash devastating magic upon the battlefield.#!"
 fog_spirits_flavor:0 "Whispering shadows and screeching faces in the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E], [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E] Spirits are an exception of the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E]. Not men or the creations of their mind, they are something from a time long past. Ethereal and vengeful in equal amounts.#!"
 golem_infantry_flavor:0 "The Golden Statues of Wolmbaz-nza, or the City of Golden Towers, march at the height of nearly two men. Crafted from golden metals and powered by a mix of clockwork and unknown magic, they are a devastating sight on the battlefield. Some superstitious soldiers claim that when one puts an ear to their chest, you can hear panicked whispers in ancient tongues...#!"
 airships_flavor:0 "An entirely Adabyssian design, based on concepts and technologies recovered from the City of Golden Towers. Airships are considered insanity by people of the north, but have increasingly become the norm in the jungles of the south, ferrying soldiers and striking cities from above.#!"
 darksteel_bombards_flavor:0 "Forged in the searing heat of the Forge of Korlacu, using the rare ores extracted from the fully restored Korlacan mines, the Darksteel Bombards are the pinnacle of Korlacan ingenuity. These fearsome siege weapons, crafted from an alloy as unyielding as the faith of their creators, can shatter walls and break armies. They are a symbol of the might of civilization, proof that industry and progress reign supreme over the chaos of the wild.#!"
 darksteel_colossi_flavor:0 "Towering constructs of metal and fire, the Darksteel Colossi are forged in the sacred furnaces of the Forge of Korlacu. Animated by the unyielding will of Korlacan industry and powered by the rare alloys from restored mines, these mechanical behemoths embody the triumph of progress over nature. Designed to crush armies and terrify enemies, they march as living monuments to the glory of civilization and the enduring strength of the Eternal Flame.#!"
 autocrossbowmen_flavor:0 "The Mundimbi are considered the elite of the vast Adabyssian military. Wielding strange golden crossbows, the devices they wield are startlingly accurate and can loose multiple bolts without reloading, thanks to a curious mechanism that feeds in new bolts from an attached box.#!"
 golems_flavor:0 "Lifeless clay and stone made animate by the energies of [aervalr|E], golems are capable of following simple and direct instructions from anyone who knows the correct passphrase. Guided by trusted human captains, they stride into battle without fear or hesitation.#!"
 siege_golems_flavor:0 "Titans of clay and stone made animate by the energies of [aervalr|E], siege golems are of devastating entire regiments by their lonesome.#!"
 griffon_riders_flavor:0 "The flower of Marcher chivalry. The death of many a foe to Chevalie has been heralded by a bright flash from a clear sky followed shortly thereafter by the war cries of a death diving squadron of Griffon Riders, armor blazing with the reflected sun.#!"
 griffon_silencers_flavor:0 "The honor of riding a griffon into battle is afforded to only the best of the fighting men the Anti Magic Orders can muster. They circle the battlefield, swooping downwards to pick off vulnerable [magi|E].#!"
 bloodbound_flavor:0 "Squadrons of soldiers sworn in brotherhood with each other in the name of Deiphartoros, the Bloodbound have sworn an oath of vengeance against all who have done injustice to the Iyrossi. They fight with a terrifying tenacity, using tactics inspired by their Aversarian oppressors.#!"

 home_legions_flavor:0 "The ancient heart of Aversaria still beats with martial fervor. While the Legions of old marched away to die at the Battle of Elysian Pass, their counterparts in the Home Legions carry on many of their traditions and fighting styles.#!"
 pure_pikes_flavor:0 "With five meter long pikes and a reputation for suicidal bravery, these pikemen are a mainstay in Opakhasian armies. Opakhasian strategy manuals state as fact that these are the only soldiers in [aeras|E] who can reliably hold against charging Marcher knights.#!"
 legion_outriders_flavor:0 "The endless plains of Eastern Aversaria present a military challenge like nothing else on the continent. In this land the Outriders have developed a fearsome reputation for their husbandry. They travel like nomads, relying on nothing but their mares for weeks at a time.#!"
 north_shields_flavor:0 "These elite infantry are almost unrecognizable as Aversarian Legionnaires. Banners sporting barbarian sigils and topped with strange idols fly as equals alongside traditional Aversarian symbols. These oddities do little to blunt their prowess in combat.#!"
 legion_marines_flavor:0 "The most poorly paid, overlooked, and disparaged legions in Aversaria, the Marine Legions nevertheless maintain a combat record rivaling even the State Legions. Patrolling some of the most treacherous and pirate-infested waters of the world, Marine Legionnaires often see dozens of battles by the time their land-bound counterparts experience their first.#!"
 duneriders_flavor:0 "Having adopted wholesale the locals' methods of fighting, Duneriders appear as if from nowhere and melt back into the desert as soon as their bloody work is complete. Some spit on them as having 'gone barbarian' but none can doubt their brutal effectiveness.#!"
 stepwalkers_flavor:0 "[magi|E] cults renowned for their secrecy - or brazen lack thereof depending on the sect to which they owe allegiance. Regardless of their diversity, these groups maintain some of the oldest and most esoteric magical traditions in Sarradon.#!"
 kikarsag_heavy_cav_flavor:0 "Clad in fearsome masked armor and riding heavily barded horses, common soldiers sometimes mistake Proven Riders for a bizarre form of golem when seen from afar. Their deadly charges and peerless heavy cavalry tactics usually mean there are few survivors able to dispute this conclusion.#!"
 huntsmen_flavor:0 "To a Kardwen huntsman there is no man or beast, only prey. Adorned with the heads of those unable to escape them, few have seen a Kardwen hunting party, and even fewer live to tell the tale."
 mountainstrikers_flavor:0 "Though their homeland has been left behind, Goan skill at alpine combat remains, and they continue organize into elite teams of Mountainstrikers. As they march in search of a new home, they will assist their people in overcoming the strongest barriers.#!"
 stoneforged_flavor:0 "The Stoneforged are a modern adaptation of the ancient Goan Mountainstrikers, now armed with more advanced equipment and expanded to greater numbers. Though they sacrifice some of the mobility of their predecessors, they have more than made up for it in hitting power, and none can claim that there are any more deadly opponents on the heights.#!"
 observant_flavor:0 "The Observant are a group of warrior-monks that have long been associated with the Huegodocs. They view battle as merely another experience the Dreamer, and have become skilled archers so that they can both participate and observe said conflicts.#!"
 cloud_riders_flavor:0 "#F Sarminian horsewomen were feared across the Kathunian steppe, and now they bring their prowess to Aversaria. They are some of the Continent's most peerless archers, rumoured to be able to put out a man's eyes at two hundred paces at full gallop.#!"
 sunstriders_flavor:0 "#F The new way of Saminian war is of heavy shock cavalry overrunning any armies foolish enough to stand in their way. Their discipline and skill at arms rivals even that of the legendary Marcher Knights.#!"
 huegodoc_legion_flavor:0 "Were one to see the legions marching through Huegodoc cities, one would be forgiven for believing the Aversarians had returned. Instead, they have formed their own legions, hoping to mirror the Aversarians' success militarily.#!"
 adventurers_flavor:0 "Hailing from far and wide, adventurers are thirsty for loot and a new land to call home."
 adventurers_maa_flavor:0 "Hailing from far and wide, adventurers are thirsty for loot and a new land to call home."
 legend_hunters_flavor:90 "Well-armed and seasoned veterans, these adventurers are fit to challenge the mightiest monsters on [aeras|E]."
 war_mammoth_flavor:0 "#F Adorned with ritual tattoos and markings, these mammoths bring the fury of the old north to the battlefield!#!"
 mubaaizun_flavor:0 "A mubaaizun is a champion of a [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] army; often the best warriors of a lord will participate in a ritual duel before the battle commences, fighting to the death. These duels are often accompanied with each army chanting or insulting one another, and there have been instances - such as the [battle_of_the_mubaaizun_fix|E] - where multiple duels happen before battle commences, often to avenge a dead mubaaizun."
 krialetil_flavor:0 "The Krialetil are the guardians of the Armazli Mountains, and have been the greatest defenders of Amaghea since the days of Parnaz 'the Great'. Krialetil regiments are trained to die before surrendering an inch of ground to their enemies.#!"
 tsanruti_flavor:0 "Tsanruti bands form the primary defence of Charchac strongholds, scouting out foes with excellent precision. Whilst many have turned to banditry since their formation, Tsanruti are still employed by Charchac communities in need of protectors.#!"
 jokhosani_flavor:0 "The Jokhosani wield long pikes, nearing eight meters in length, and are never forgotten when Amaghea raises its armies. Whilst not renowned for their bravery, the Jokhosani are known to leave few enemies alive when they take to the field.#!"
 tskherosan_flavor:0 "The favored warriors of Mahratians, Tskherosan riders are known for their speed and ruthlessness across Amaghea.#!"
 sahkmavali_flavor:0 "The guards of the hidden temples of Aygaea, Sahkmavali often serve in groups no larger than fifty men. However, despite their small size, Sahkmavali are masters of mountain warfare whose skill is hard to equal in their home territory.#!"
 mezilachitnen_flavor:0 "Trained to use a longbow as part of court ritual, the most skilled warriors of the Draneti have always been chosen to serve as the Mezilachitnen. Whilst few, they are the pinnacle of Amaghean archers.#!"
 talabhau_flavor:0 "Talabhāu once served as the elite guards of the Vanēlāmāk Haytrakhati; in its absence, any worthy prince may call upon them.#!"
 jaanvarkis_flavor:0 "Moulded by years of hunting, these veterans of the forest are known for their skillful yet swift style of fighting- earning the name Vyuharaksha or 'Gliding reavers' by their enemies. With sufficient training in contemporary warfare, they become expert skirmishers."
 kanpahuri_flavor: "Trained extensively to fight with axes, the Kan'pahuri are masters of [sevra_par|E] in both battle and celebations.#!"
 visvasavrak_flavor:0 "Initially founded to defeat hordes of the undead, the Viśvāsavrak fight to the death in complete loyalty to their liege lord."
 kaphral_flavor:0 "Kāphral are skilled with all manner of blades, but their speciality is the spear; short and swift, the Duibindir they utilise has sharp stakes at either end.#!"
 spirits_of_the_horn_flavor:0 "The Spirits of the Horn are long dead and mighty warriors that had pledged their battle-hardened souls to [velos|E]. They are said to be in service of the Black Horn for all time, coming to aid those who are in need of their power."
 oltenic_light_horsemen_flavor:0 "Öltenic Riders descend from warrior traditions learned since the [aironoian_migration|E]. These riders were considered some of the finest in [aversaria|E]."
 oltenic_spearmen_flavor:0 "Öltenic Spears have long specialized in unique fighting styles to combat the ferocious horse lords of Aironoi."
 oltenic_horse_archers_flavor:0 "Öltenic Archers descend from warrior traditions learned since the [aironoian_migration|E]. They are known to be deadly and accurate, and have maintained control over the steppe because of it."
 theugombrian_warrior_kinband_flavor:0 "Composed of bonded kingroups of young men, Kinbands range far and wide, selling their services to the highest bidder, fighting with metal armor and nearly suicidal bravery. Those bands who survive form the nucleus of future Theugombrian lineages."
 theugombrian_iron_brotherhood_flavor:0 "Steeped in the arts of metal and war magic, Theugombrian Iron Brotherhoods are kinbands formed around magi bloodlines, fighting with both spell and sword. Their rites are known to enhance the bite of a blade such that it can cut through mail like paper."
 leki_herdmasters_flavor:0 "Pastoralists by nature, in times of need the Leki people pick up their arms and form elusive skirmisher warbands. Putting their knowledge of the lay of the land to a more martial use, they strike hard and fast, disappearing into the surrounding terrain before the enemy can mount a response."
 chasm_terrors_flavor:0 "The Redlands are filled with an assortment of the most terrifying and evil creatures known on [aeras|E]. Sentient corpse-filled chasms, swarms of giant wasps that grow for weeks within living hosts, many-armed eyes that crawl across the walls and open gaping tooth-filled maws within their pupils... only the Redlanders seem to somehow be able to tame them from war, which sadly means that even those who wisely stay as far away from the Redlands as possible may not be spared the terrors within."
 redland_cultists_flavor:0 "Some are but a few decades old, but most have passed one century or many. Undying, their inhuman forms twist into purpose at the beck and call of the dread gods that these [magi|E] worship. They kill to grow stronger, for the Void hungers for the erasure of all things. Lives especially."
 voidhosts_flavor:0 "Perhaps once human, Voidhosts are now 'living' fonts of entropy. Hooded figures that spell doom across any land they walk, tales tell of travelers who lower their hood within temples and cities and devour thousands into the hellish darkness of the void that now composes their body. When the Redlanders march to war, hundreds of Voidhosts can be spotted, and the world thus trembles in fear."
 enfleshed_grotesquerie_flavor:0 "The Grotesquerie is a hideous mass of sinew and bone, composed of lesser cultists, slaves, and any beasts that were sublimated into the mass. Its grotesque form strikes fear in any who stand against it, and most choose to surrender to its fleshy embrace."
 voidspawn_flavor:0 "Incarnates of the primordial entropy, Voidspawn are the shadows cast by powers beyond [aeras|E], summoned on the mortal plane through some foul design. Formless and alien to the existence itself, everything that falls under their caress is stripped of any semblance of life, order, and structure."
 archonarachs_flavor:0 "Courtiers, retainers, and valets of the Spider Court, Archonarachs are rarely seen on [aeras|E] outside of the hunting parties and bloodsports organized by their nobles. As large as a fully grown warhorse, each of their arachnid limbs ends in a chitinous hand with deadly talons strong enough to dent metal. Archonarachs craft silk-woven faces for themselves and place them in front of their cephalothoraces, taking great offense when not addressed by their created persona."
 blade_tendrils_flavor:0 "Blade Tendrils are the most numerous of the Maw's spawn, and by far the weakest. Sprouting from any corpse that comes into contact with the contaminated flesh, they take over their host in a violent explosion of gore and brain matter, standing up as a shambling humanoid cadaver with a long whip-like tentacle in place of their head."
 marrowdrones_flavor:0 "Marrowdrones are the Maw's hunters, posited to overwhelm anything that can oppose the spread of the Fleshcurse. Encased in a bone exoskeleton, they shrug off mortal blows to deliver a storm of launched bone spikes followed by a crushing charge."
 hungering_mouths_flavor:0 "Most favored among the Maw's children, the Hungering Mouths are colossal amalgamations of flesh and bone, heralding the advent of the Fleshcurse. Countless fangs, talons, and bone spikes emerge from their hulking bodies, consuming everything around these monstrosities in a futile bid to sate their endless hunger."
 bronzecast_flavor:0 "The pinnacle of Dahangon bronze metallurgy, the Bronzecast are enormous and intricately carved cannons that make use of gunpowder to fire metallic projectiles to lay waste to the strongest of walls."
 thorn_maidens_flavor:0 "Honed through a lifetime of strict martial training, the elite warriors of the Dayarka are said to bear the strength of ten men, and are feared for hunting down their foes from their unseen jungle canopies."
 death_seekers_flavor:0 "[death_seekers|E] are master swordsmen who can easily cut down both men and horse alike."
 sidharakyan_flavor:0 "Sidhārakyan are masters of using their curved axes to cut down lightly armored foes that trespass on their shores."
 dhageray_flavor:0 "Dhā'geray Warriors are famous for their loyalty, and for fighting to the death. Once their leader falls, their entire retinue of warriors are expected to die with them."
 markwardens_flavor:0 "Lithe and swift, the Markwardens inflict touch-based curses and marks to their enemies to devastating effect."
 bluescars_flavor:0 "The feared warriors of the Talareg are marked with tattoos of an unknown blue dye and feared for the ferocity."
 war_hounds_flavor: "For as long as there have been soldiers on [aeras|E], there have been loyal dogs to accompany them. As Skorikiakas poet Anvian Viynaxich once said, "Closer to the warrior than their shield is the hound, which so quickly conquers even the most steel-clad heart.""
 maples_marauders_flavor: "While the company once had but a single hound to its name, Maple and her scions have become a near-legendary pack of war hounds."
 azmaram_flavor: "The Azmaram march in lockstep, advancing on their enemies with an impenetrable wall of gleaming shields and keen sarissas."
