No, there is no other explanation than divine inspiration—no, divine incarnation.\n\nLet the priests believe what they may, as long as they tell my soldiers to worship me by spilling heathen blood.

 marcher_lifepath.0100.desc:0 "Recently, [reformer.GetUIName] has proclaimed a Council of Wayfathers in [reformer.GetHerHis] capital of [capital.GetNameNoTier]. After several days of deliberation, an official decree was announced declaring that the Waypath would be, as it was originally envisioned, free for all to choose as they will. This has been a controversial decision with the nobility, who see the commoners' ability to choose their own path as a violation of their rights and a threat to their way of life, but with the Wayfather's of Chevalie in agreement there is little to be done.\n\nWhile the nobility bicker and complain, the peasantry have largely taken to celebration, though most will still no doubt pointedly encourage their children to follow the Way of Harvests."

The formalization of decades of stratification in Marcher society, the decision enshrines the institution of serfdom as the rule of the land.\n\nWhile controversial among the commoners, much of the nobility have celebrated the decision, happy that peasants can no longer study in the arts of war or rulership without their permission."
