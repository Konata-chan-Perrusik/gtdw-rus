He spent most of his early childhood in the summer palace of [GetBuilding('gh_anjari_burz_01').GetName|V], later entering court politics in his bid for the throne. He is widely recognized to have orchestrated the assassination of his younger brother.\n\nAfter winning small-scale conflicts in the south and gaining a certain reputation for ruthlessness toward his enemies, Pejman was formally chosen as successor by his father, who shortly after passed away. He ascended the throne in 1184 IS at the age of twenty-six, after securing the Qanamsar's favor and playing the succession game in Hiklahnate's fashion. He shortly proceeded to order the assassination of his most prominent rival and pretender: his second-cousin Shavur.\n\nThe birth of his first child, and later the advent of [frodbrokna|E] and the end of [Concept('gh_zenda','The Prophecy')|E], would seemingly change his views on succession and traditional Amsari customs. He attempted to end the long-standing practice of infanticide and siblicide that had defined Hiklahnate politics for centuries. For turning away from the customs of his forebears, and the change in character that followed, he would henceforth be known as 'the Kind'.\n\nEarly in his reign, the court's coffers were nigh-empty and the throne mired in debt. Yet by the 1220s IS, through a mix of taxation and careful diplomacy, Pejman had stabilized the treasury. He negotiated key trade agreements with [GetTitleByKey('e_ayyar').GetBaseNameNoTier|V] and the wardenite eastern republics. His most controversial act came in 1223  IS, when he authorized the sale of [GetTitleByKey('c_baqerabad').GetBaseNameNoTier|V] to the [GetTitleByKey('d_marcher_amsari_republic').GetBaseNameNoTier|V], securing the largest influx of gold the realm had seen in decades.\n\nPejman's domestic diplomacy made use of his numerous children, sending them across the Hiklahn to tie himself and his vassals together in an attempt to counterbalance a century of growing vassal autonomy. This would, however, ultimately contribute to the civil war that plagued [amsar|E] for decades after his death."
