After the tribes had spent a week debating a course of action and largely just nearly spiraling into killing one another right there, Cormag then arrived along with thirty of his warriors (largely of the direct Fenrus clan) still filthy and bloody from the journey and without an eye. After tossing the head of Ravmir into the gathering tent - complete with what appeared to be bite marks all along the neck - he announced that the Fenrus and Valgr tribes both unanimously agreed to his claim for leadership, and told the assembled chieftains, shaman, Magi and others that the old dog would see them outside in the sparring circle if they disagreed. None left the tent, and the Fenvir tribes soon migrated south towards $cenware_link$ Cenware#! not long after."
