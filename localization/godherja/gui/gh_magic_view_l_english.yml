# Lifestyle cantrips 
 ritual_sacrifice_desc: "Every death causes a small release of arcane energy, so in theory even the most rudimentary slaying of a person can serve as a ritual sacrifice.

 fire_magick_desc: "The humble fireball is perhaps the most widespread spell in all of [aeras|E]. Though it requires little training and almost no preparation to cast, numerous methods exist to allow a [magi|E] to 'precharge' stronger projectiles for a period of time."

# Pearls and Pits of Gold artifact
 gold_plague_name: "Gold Plague"
 gold_plague_desc: "A curse which eats through precious metals not unlike how the dreaded plague eats through a man. Its rot begins as a slight smudging, before slowly turning any infected precious item into a dull, slate-gray and acric smelling metal with the consistency of caked soil. Worse it spreads on contact, from coin to coin and pocket to pocket. All known precious metals are vunlerable, even the usually involate gold. Though it will inevitably burn itself out, it can impoverish scores of mercantile communities before doing so."
 ancestral_betrayal_name: "Ancestral Betrayal"
 ancestral_betrayal_desc: "A malignant spell which binds an almost always unwilling ghost into a homicidal rage directed specifically at their own children. The spiritual turmoil within the poor spirit usually winds up tearing it apart and leaving its intelligence insensate and permanently catatonic, but not before either killing, wounding, or emotionally scarring one or more of its terrified offspring."

 # Greenwender of Sarradon Spells
 justice_of_the_primeval_garden_name:89 "Justice of the Primeval Garden"
 justice_of_the_primeval_garden_desc:89 "The mythical woodland that once covered northern [sarradon|E] was a harsh and lawless place, the only justice being that enacted by brute force. In these times, the fate of defeat at the hands of another creature was not just death, but ones' very soul being forfeit to the victor. Most famously, this was how the legendary Dishali and Awgali grew to their near-godlike power after slaying leviathans, Forest Kings, and demigods beyond count.\n\nOr at least, that's how the myths go.\n\nNowadays, few believe this idea to be anything other than a fanciful storytelling device. Some, however, claim that this law of a world long-gone is not just real, but still holds some amount of power — and merely needs to be correctly invoked to work once again."
 cedar_witchs_hex_name:89 "Cedar-Witch's Hex"
 cedar_witchs_hex_desc:89 "In the ancient times of the Kingdom of Sarradon, an unnamed governor of Tragoneia once wished to build a fleet worthy of an empire, his endeavor greedily consuming every tract of woodland around the city of Carmine. One day, he would travel into his personal hunting preserve — and never emerge. Instead, the charred bodies of him and his entourage would be found strewn about the forest, even though their surroundings had no indications of a wildfire whatsoever.\n\nTo this day, such mysteriously burnt bodies are occasionally found in the primeval cedar groves of Sarradon, and it is often whispered that these unfortunates fell afoul with practitioners that dabble with some of the oldest powers of the southern continent..."
 embercrown_coronation_name:89 "Embercrown Coronation"
 embercrown_coronation_desc:89 "Long before the current age of man, when Sarradon was still green, the terrible Forest Kings of old reigned; they wore no crowns made of gold, but of pure flame. Their coronation was a glorious affair, but the millennia since their downfall has reduced it to just another strange relic from a time long gone, the ritual's gradual corruption ultimately resulting in it only being able to produce a wreath of embers. Nonetheless, it doubtless still holds some sliver of its former power."

 twin_gods_hex_of_wrath_desc:89 "When the Twin God's clashed with Korlacu in the Sundering War, They sought to target Korlacu's followers who thought themselves safe to still hunt in the sacred jungle. So they taught their most trusted disciples the language of their origin and how to sing a spell of wrath into the very jungle. Those who where bold enough to resist the Twin Gods after were occasionally torn apart by the forest. Ever since travelers through the jungle will occasionally find bodies split in half, half partially buried in the ground, while the other half suspended in the trees."



 # Temple of the Vitreous Precept Spells
 shattercurse_name: "Shattercurse"
 shattercurse_desc: "A commonly cited favorite among glass [magi|E] enthusiasts, the Curse of Worldly Shattering—usually abbreviated as #EMP Shattercurse#!—is a staple of many magical arsenals. Skirting the line between a [ritual|E] and a cantrip, it is valued for the simplicity of its sympathetic link, #EMP relative#! effectiveness, and even more relative casting speed."
 conduit_of_a_clear_mind_name: "Conduit of a Clear Mind"
 conduit_of_a_clear_mind_desc: "Just as broken glass can be melted down and shaped anew, an ailing mind can be rekindled with vigor and given a new purpose. Also known as the Scholars' Spell, #EMP Conduit of a Clear Mind#! allows the psyche of the casting [magi|E] to reassert itself amidst a sea of uncertainty, restoring their focus to what matters most."
 shard_of_imbued_knowledge_name: "Shard of Imbued Knowledge"
 shard_of_imbued_knowledge_desc: "Glass shards are one of the less practiced methods of imparting knowledge, mundane or otherwise, into the minds of willing recipients—both due to the intimacy of the process and the toll it extracts on the mind. The affected memories are temporarily muddled, and the experience is equally [Concept('stress','Stressful')|E] to the tutor and the student."
 kumhants_veil_name: "Kumhant's Veil"
 kumhants_veil_desc: "Deriving from the doctrines of the traditionally pacifistic [GetReligionByKey('sunarwei_religion').GetAdjective] creed, #EMP Kumhant's Veil#! is a blessing of vanguards and protectors, warding against mortal blows and granting the warriors unnatural grace and fluidity. Historically, the [ritual|E] was often jointly cast by the [magi|E] of the armies engaging in highly regulated [GetCulturePillar('heritage_kherkeloi').GetName] warfare to reduce casualties and facilitate prisoner exchanges after battles."
 mellifluent_vessel_name: "Mellifluent Vessel"
 mellifluent_vessel_desc: "The time-honored profession of glassinger was first born when [magi|E] discovered a way to enchant vocal cords with glass-like properties, granting the voice a unique and melodious quality. Within less than a century, the spell and its users have spread across the Sea of Empires, with some even electing to make the transmutation permanent."
 ururras_augury_name: "Ururra's Augury"
 ururras_augury_desc: "Ururra was the head priestess and, after one successful coup, the ruler of the Sunakari palace-city of [Glossary('Gishvosk','GH_GISHVOSK_GLOSS')]. Having devised a particularly potent divination [ritual|E] that involved throwing glass beads into a shallow bowl of boiling juniper oil, she waged a campaign of terror to combat future threats both real and perceived, ultimately perishing in fiery riot that consumed the city. Subsequent generations of [magi|E] have concluded that the spell does indeed reveal the future—just the worst version of it; modern iterations propose the implementation of a correctional criterion to offset its premonitional bias."
 forge_of_the_solemn_visionary_name: "Forge of the Solemn Visionary"
 forge_of_the_solemn_visionary_desc: "Before the rise of [GetCulturePillar('heritage_kherkeloi').GetName] palace-cities, before the ruin of the [wars_of_dominion|E], before the [Concept('ertomax','Ertomaxians')|E] and the [Concept('astilik_empire','Astiliks')|E], there were the [Glossary('Nugators','GH_NUGATORS_GLOSS')]—the enlightened tyrant-rulers of the sea. Governing with a silk glove wrapped in a slaver's chain, they are often credited with founding the first [aironoian_bronze_age|E] civilizations, shaping realms that would endure long after their own passing. Though largely forgotten beneath the weight of histories, some of the Nugators' [Concept('ritual','Rituals')|E] have withstood the test of time, eventually becoming instruments of advancement for the very peoples they once ruled."
 supplication_to_the_unfettered_muse_name: "Supplication to the Unfettered Muse"
 supplication_to_the_unfettered_muse_desc: "To receive the blessing of [Glossary('Nashanar','GH_NASHANAR_GLOSS')], the supplicant must undergo a three-day fast, ingesting nothing but a spell-treated mixture of milk and poppy seed oil to enter a prolonged state of induced mania. Once in it, the individual typically begins to shun anything they perceive as trivial compared to the task they obsess over—such as food, sleep, and general bodily wellness. While subjects exhibit remarkable mental stability despite neglecting their physical needs, the ritual offers no real protection against afflictions or malnutrition."
 lacerating_glasswinds_name: "Lacerating Glasswinds"
 lacerating_glasswinds_desc: "Where one cut is painful, ten can be deadly—and a hundred will fell any warrior. Glass [magi|E] are thus known, feared, and by some, despised for their ability to conjure vast storms of their namesake material, sometimes blanketing entire towns in kaleidoscopic cyclones of gleaming glass shards. Used either as a last resort before an assaulting force or as an assault in itself, the [ritual|E] always exacts a deadly toll on those unfortunate enough to be caught in its crossfire."
 interminable_nexus_name: "Interminable Nexus"
 interminable_nexus_desc: "Among the many petty Sunakari warlords who seized power in the aftermath of the [wars_of_dominion|E], only two things were universally ubiquitous—rampant paranoia toward their peers and an unyielding resolve to cast aside anything that could impede progress. A rightful child of their ambitions, the [ritual|E] of #EMP Interminable Nexus#! warps the target's perception to easily reveal all the inefficiencies in their surroundings at the cost of an intense compulsion to correct them—no matter the cost."
 pane_of_passage_name: "Pane of Passage"
 pane_of_passage_desc: "The use of glass panes for spatial movement has long been a part of [GetCulturePillar('heritage_kherkeloi').GetName] folklore, with the exact origins of such a craft being irrevocably lost to history. Nevertheless, with a precise mix of materials, advanced knowledge, and the skill of a master glassmith, teleportation becomes a reality—albeit a fleeting one, as the glass gateway darkens and cracks mere days after it has been enchanted."

 lustrous_banner_name: "Lustrous Banner"
 lustrous_banner_desc: "Glory, wealth, fear, anger—many are the reasons one might take up the sword and forsake a life of peace.

 plague_ward_name: "Plague Ward"
 plague_ward_desc: "Diverting the tide of disease is no easy task—and is something that demands collective effort and #EMP sacrifice#!.

 weapons_of_perdition_name: "Weapons of Perdition"
 weapons_of_perdition_desc: "In ancient times, the Halite Temple was guarded by four hundred hallowed sentinels, standing in endless vigil over its sacred reliquaries and keeping watch over the boundless streams of passing pilgrims. Though disbanded during the time of [Concept('otachedian_empire','Otached')|E], their arts have spread far beyond their original purpose, and formerly exclusive [perdition_armaments|E] eventually became a mainstay among the elite warriors of many Aironoian and [Concept('kashirya','Kashiryan')|E] armies."

 kingsfall_name: "Kingsfall"
 kingsfall_desc: "No kingdom is eternal, no king a monolith. A favored tool of seditionists and puppetmasters, the [ritual|E] of #EMP Kingsfall#! inflames the small divisions and fractures inherent to any power structure, widening them into irreconcilable fissures that turn ally against ally, sibling against sibling."

 koshmers_dreaming_archive_name: "Koshmer's Dreaming Archive"
 koshmers_dreaming_archive_desc: "Koshmer was a renowned 3rd-century Khodomi scholar and Wane-Tender, famed for his near-miraculous treatments, unorthodox views—and for vanishing without a trace at the height of his glory. His only legacy to the world was a singular [ritual|E], left behind on a torn page of his grimoire—a spell that, when cast before sleep, transports the dreamer's mind into a dimly lit library, overflowing with knowledge both medicinal and mundane, until the moment of awakening. Altogether, the experience is perfectly safe—so long as one takes care not to disturb other visitors or stumble into the webs of the Librarian."

 final_emissary_of_peace_name: "Final Emissary of Peace"
 final_emissary_of_peace_desc: "The Temple's envoys came again today, bearing the same offer. [GetFaithByKey('sunarwei').HighGodName] sees, my family has always been generous in our donations to their coffers, but the priests' demands grow unreasonable. What they seek is beyond charity, beyond tribute—yet I have no choice but to accept what amounts to vassalage in all but name.
