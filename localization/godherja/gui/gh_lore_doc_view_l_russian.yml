 FOREWORD_TEXT_BEFORE_IMAGE:0 "     Изначально я создал Godherja: The Dying World как модификацию для Crusader Kings II, в которой была представлена Империя, которая 'заимствовала' многое у Таргариенов из «Песни Льда и Пламени» и рушилась под натиском варварских вторжений, напоминающих эпоху Великого переселения народов. В отличие от многих фантастических произведений, которыми я наслаждался, варвары в данном случае были морально правильной фракцией, останавливающей оставшихся Империалов от уничтожения мира через вызов демонов. Это во многом базировалось на моей первой попытке создания конверсии (также для Crusader Kings II) под названием An Essarian Tale, разработка которой завершилась, когда популярность обрела The New Order: The Last Days of Europe, и я посвятил своё время этому проекту. Единственное, что осталось от той эпохи разработки Godherja, помимо базовых идей, — это карта, которая стала основой мира, ныне известного как Аэрас."

 FOREWORD_TEXT_AFTER_IMAGE:0 "\n\n     Во время работы над The New Order я представлял себе ещё один фантазийный мир. Похожий переворот клише о тёмных варварах и доблестных рыцарях, но на фоне Крестовых походов. Моё внимание привлекла картина рыцарей в ослепительно белой одежде, скачущих на лошадях через мрачный, синеватый лес. Что-то в этом заставило меня представить, что рыцари были злодеями. Они носили такую ослепительно белую одежду слишком демонстративно, почти как будто приглашали представить их тёмную сущность за суровыми лицами. В деревьях, как я вообразил, сидели арабские воины в чёрных одеждах и бронзе, сражаясь с злыми крестоносцами, захватившими их дом. Это была странная смесь, вероятно, скрытых политических взглядов и похожих идей из первых воплощений Godherja.\n\n     Однажды ночью, проезжая по шоссе Северной Каролины на своей работе, связанной с путешествиями, я включил Spotify, решил, что мне нужно фантазийное вдохновение, и выбрал случайный плейлист под названием «Викингская музыка». Включилась песня Trøllabundin от Eivør, красивая композиция на традиционном фарерском. Возможно, из-за долгой полуночной поездки и моего джетлага, смешавшегося с чрезмерно бурным воображением, песня наполнила мой разум одной из самых детализированных сцен, которые я когда-либо представлял. Я увидел горы и бескрайние сосновые леса, окутанные эфемерным туманом, «варваров», крадущихся в подлеске под небольшим выступом. Над ними стоял человек в красных, чёрных и серебряных доспехах с изображением дракона, одинокий страж большого лагеря позади него, где трещали костры и факелы, скрытые густым туманом. Камера двигалась так, чтобы человек стоял лицом к ней, отвернувшись от выступа и леса, так что можно было видеть его усталое лицо. Внезапно копьё пронзает его грудь, и камера поворачивается влево, показывая, как других стражей устраняют.\n\n     Затем начинается битва: костры падают в хаосе, поджигая палатки; драконьи солдаты сражаются с варварами, вооружёнными топорами и копьями, туман сгущается, а из горящей палатки с имперским величием выходит человек в красных и золотых одеяниях и обрушивает на варвара мощный огненный луч. Человек в одеяниях сеет массовое разрушение, кровь капает из его носа, когда шаман в племенной одежде блокирует его заклинание и отвечает своим. Среди битвы стоят рыцари в традиционных европейских латах — наёмники для «Империалов», как я стал называть драконьих солдат, — каким-то образом оказываются в центре событий и вынуждены пробиваться сквозь обе стороны, чтобы сбежать. Под конец песни, когда играют последние ноты, через туман прорывается жуткий рёв. Все оборачиваются в замешательстве, когда несколько Империалов и варваров с криками выбегают из тумана, а за ними поднимается огромный силуэт. Наконец, я представил, как камера отдаляется, показывая огромный регион великих лесов, поглощённых этим туманом, вспышки бесконечных битв внутри и горящие прибрежные города на его границе.\n\n     Спустя неделю друг предложил мне попытаться предложить потенциальный мод Paradox, чтобы получить ранний доступ к Crusader Kings III. Я дал себе час, чтобы придумать что-то. За этот час я написал первый документ с лором Godherja, объединив все вышеперечисленные идеи и ещё больше из Age of Wonders, Heroes of Might and Magic III, Dragon Age: Origins и The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Мод вышел, затем вырос, и вскоре я собрал команду невероятно впечатляющих программистов, писателей и художников. Вместе с нашей столь же впечатляющей общиной мы добавили к моей оригинальной структуре гораздо больше, чем я мог себе представить или надеяться, чтобы достичь такого качества и масштаба. Через два месяца после года работы над Godherja, приблизительный подсчёт всех наших текстов составляет более 220 000 слов. Это было бы невозможно без такой замечательной команды, и у нас впереди ещё так много работы. Оглядываясь назад, я хотел показать, как далеко мы продвинулись, представив новое воплощение теперь уже почтенного документа с лором.\n\n     Хотя он всё ещё в основном правильный, за этот год мы добавили и уточнили столько лора, что он стал устаревшим и часто неверно истолковывается. Так что последние две недели я посвятил значительному расширению по сравнению с тем часом, который он получил в первый раз. Ниже вы найдёте чрезвычайно длинный, чрезвычайно подробный и всё ещё совершенно базовый обзор Godherja. Пожалуйста, помните, что это всего лишь введение. В каждом моменте есть значительное количество лора, который ещё не рассказан, и ещё больше сидит в наших планах, которые мы ещё не добавили. Следующий документ с лором может занять месяцы на написание, но он никогда не будет всеобъемлющим. Внизу вы найдёте ссылки на несколько других материалов, которые могут помочь вам узнать больше о мире или помочь вам в игре.\n\n     Но, будь то из-за того, что вы просто хотите насладиться лором, разобраться, во что вы пытаетесь играть, или потому, что кто-то прислал вам эту ссылку, я надеюсь, что вам понравится. Godherja стал моим любимым проектом на сегодняшний день, и я с нетерпением жду будущего и всего, что может с ним прийти.\n\n     ~J, главный разработчик"

 AGE_OF_DUST_TITLE:0 "Эпоха Пыли"  
 AGE_OF_DUST_TEXT_1:0 "     В начале не было ничего.\n\n     Это не было настоящим началом, потому что начало требует времени, а реальность ещё не развила таких понятий. Были только пустые миры и измерения, бесконечная пустота из пыли и тьмы, лишённая звёзд и жизни.\n\n     Первые существа были богами. Называть их так — ошибка, простая попытка осмыслить существование вещей, которых никто не понимает. Слово, используемое детьми для описания понятий, которые слишком сложны для тех, кто привязан к реальности. Это не были существа; они не думали; они не существовали. Это были понятия и силы; это были законы реальности, существование цветов или убеждений. Звёзды без существования, которые никогда не были видимы человеческим глазом и никогда не могли быть поняты или осмыслены, формировались, расширялись, разделялись и взрывались в пространстве, которое не принадлежало нашему миру, в невидимой завесе, определяющей ход реальности через свои колебания.\n\n     Это было измерение существования, где даже движение пыли управляло самими законами физики в других мирах. Звёзды становились нейронами для бесконечных «разумов», которые изгибали и формировали эти законы, пыль кружилась и превращалась в существа, не способные к действиям или мыслям, но способные изменять цвета реальности или «решать» существование силы и материи. Для человеческого разума, который сможет понять лишь малую часть этих существ через тысячу переводов, отражений и неверных интерпретаций, которые никогда не помогут нам полностью постичь их форму и функцию, боги были самой «реальностью». Не её сущностью, а её функцией. Они не думали, по крайней мере, в понятиях, которые можно понять. Они не наблюдали за реальностью, не заботились о её существовании и не углублялись в пустую бездну, которая её охватывала. Люди узнали бы только об одном их существовании, и только один из них узнал бы их.\n\n     Только один из этих богов осознавал своё существование или, по крайней мере, обладал способностью заботиться и существовать. Они делали это, как человек, ибо они создали человечество. Всё, что мы знаем, думаем и чувствуем, исходит от нашего создателя, и так же наш создатель знает, думает и чувствует. В космосе, где реальность и время — это понятия, ещё не созданные или, возможно, невозможные для применения, они существовали всегда и были только что сформированы. В мире, где боги были уникальными и неизменными силами, они были одни, были лишь мыслью в бесконечном эфире. Они не существовали, потому что материя не существовала в этом мире, и они не знали, потому что знание ещё не пришло. Но, возможно, они были первыми, кто потряс свою вселенную, создав новое понятие — концепцию концепций, первую мысль и первые вопросы о существовании.\n\n     Они были [aersanon|E].\n\n     Одинокие, без формы, без компании, без другого существа, чтобы знать или обладать концепцией знания, Аэрсанон существовали. Возможно, они были первыми, кто существовал, а возможно, как уникальное существо, просто первыми, кто мог понять существование. Аэрсанон был понятием существования и «жизни», возможно, или просто событием. Неизбежной силой, без истинной цели, кроме как запустить замыслы вселенной, создать такие вещи, как время, существование и человечество. Даже называть их существом может быть слишком, помещая в рамки то, что никогда не вместится в конечное, ибо Аэрсанон был богом. Единственным истинным Богом, ибо они были единственным богом, которого человечество когда-либо узнавало, и единственным богом, которого человечество могло хотя бы отчасти понять.\n\n     Хотя никто раньше не «чувствовал» или «думал», каждый был уникален и представлял собой и становился разными вещами. Вселенная могла содрогнуться или прийти в движение, когда они сформировались, но её внутреннее устройство никогда не могло быть понято, даже ими. Аэрсанон существовал один и без формы бесконечно, триллионы лет и эоны, или, возможно, совсем не времени, ибо время, вероятно, не существовало в их измерении. Без времени, как можно думать? Как можно знать? Разве мысль или вера не требуют времени для формирования или обработки? Аэрсанон, казалось, представлял концепцию жизни. Существования, знания, веры и размышления. Возможно, больше всего, и на этом раннем этапе «реальности» Аэрсанон стал богом всех понятий. И из всех мыслей и чувств, которые они могли бы иметь или, по крайней мере, вещей, которые человечество могло бы воспринимать как мысли и чувства, они в конечном итоге остановились на одном.\n\n     Что они были одни.\n\n     Невозможно назвать то, что почувствовал Аэрсанон, когда они двигались через пустоту тянущих и толкающих сил, одиночеством. Одиночество существовало только из этой единственной мысли, и человеческое одиночество — это всего лишь ослабленное и базовое отражение этой первой силы их существования. Но для людей, которые однажды заговорят со своим создателем, Аэрсанон провели вечность без другого существа, с которым можно было бы поговорить, без другого существа, которое они могли бы воспринять через существование, полностью уникальны и без другого, кто мог бы хотя бы испытать то, что испытали они. Если каждый бог был уникален, и каждый бог представлял собой целые силы существования, какую надежду имел Аэрсанон найти компанию? Если они могли говорить, думать или верить, то они были первыми и единственными, кто мог это делать, простое существование речи, мысли и веры было совершенно уникальной силой, которую они ввели в реальность, и только они могли по-настоящему обладать ею. Даже то, что человечество однажды унаследует, будет лишь грубой приблизительной копией.\n\n     Аэрсанон был одиночеством, ибо они сформировали, создали и определили ход этой концепции. Но они были не только одиночеством, они также стали скукой. Возможно, это были два худших проклятия, поразивших Аэрсанона, ибо какое большее несчастье, чем быть первым существом, которое думает, и находить это невыносимым? Чтобы даже сказать, что они чувствовали такие вещи, означало бы, что они были не только одиночеством и скукой, но и несчастьем, замешательством и страхом. Страхом незнания, страхом одиночества, страхом возможности бесконечного существования без единого существа, которое бы знало боль, которую они создали. До или после не было существа, которое бы знало истинное одиночество. Возможно, Аэрсанон никогда не смогли преодолеть это, ибо они никогда не могли существовать без столь важной части их существа.\n\n     Но, как и все человеческие концепции, унаследованные от их отражения, так же и упрямство. Бесконечное желание сражаться и бороться с тем, что должно быть, и против угнетающего поражения реальности. Аэрсанон могли быть одиночеством и скукой, но они также были решимостью, упорством, и больше всего — творчеством. В то время как Аэрсанон нехотя принимали своё пустое существование в измерении за пределами их собственного, они смотрели на пустоту реальности, которая двигалась вокруг движений бога, и осознали свою силу. Хотя никто никогда не мог понять функции ирреальности, возможно, мы могли бы описать то, что сделал Аэрсанон, как натягивание струн, закручивание вод или перестановку строительных блоков существования. Если Аэрсанон был богом сознания, возможно, даже богом идей, таких как «причина» и «следствие», то они также были первыми, кто понял, что они могут изгибать реальность по своему желанию.\n\n     Порядок создания вселенной — это то, что мы никогда не сможем понять или узнать. Возможно, Аэрсанон наполнили нашу вселенную звёздами, или, возможно, они создали бесконечно плотный шар материи, который они позволили взорваться наружу и сформировать космос. Возможно, солнца и звёзды за пределами них появились позже, или, возможно, они никогда не существовали как нечто большее, чем точки света, которые они надеялись добавить, чтобы украсить тьму, простой слой краски над бесконечностью.\n\n     Независимо от того, появилось ли небо до или после, Они всё ещё желали большего. Они притягивали и соединяли материю и пыль, реальность смещалась и изгибалась, чтобы соответствовать их желаниям, и так сформировался шар чистой материи, вокруг которого они направили яркий шар света и тепла, чтобы он медленно вращался и дарил тепло. Если это доставляло им временное удовлетворение, если время вообще существовало и такие термины, как «временно», могли применяться, то это не длилось долго. Аэрсанон не просто хотели создавать, они нуждались в общении. Какова ценность мыслей без их обмена? Какова ценность способности говорить без возможности слушать?\n\n     И так они наполнили [Concept('aeras','Аэрас')|E], этот шар материи, вокруг которого вращалось одинокое солнце, жизнью. Они вырезали великие разломы и долины и наполнили их водой, они использовали своё воображение, чтобы создать зелень и растения. Мир был Аэрсаноном, порождённый их разумом и созданный их усилиями и материей, через растения текла их кровь, жизнь была ничем иным, как даром, переданным от бога, который изобрёл саму её концепцию. На некоторое «время» они были довольны и этим, но их создание оставалось простым и неспособным к взаимодействию. Они могли общаться со своим творением, конечно. Растения, деревья и лишайники, всё это происходило из их крови, и в каком-то смысле знало и говорило со своим создателем. Но этого было недостаточно, их творение не могло понять концепций, о которых они хотели говорить, и поэтому Аэрсанон продолжили.\n\n     Они начали создавать животных. В их воображении возникли существа, которые могли двигаться, исследовать и, возможно, даже реагировать на окружающий мир. Они наполнили [Concept('aeras','Аэрас')|E] полчищами существ, каждое из которых было формой жизни, представляющей их собственное желание создать что-то большее. От самых мелких, незаметных существ, ползущих в почве, до огромных зверей, которые бродили по равнинам и лесам, их мир начал оживать. Но даже это не удовлетворило их. Хотя животные могли существовать и взаимодействовать с миром, они не могли осознавать его, думать о своём месте в нём или рассуждать о своём создателе. Для Аэрсанона этого было недостаточно.\n\n     И тогда, в их величайшем акте творения, они создали человека.\n\n     Человек, как их высшее творение, был наделён способностью мыслить, чувствовать и осознавать. Люди были единственными существами, способными воспринимать концепции, которые Аэрсанон так отчаянно пытались передать. Они были первыми существами, способными к самостоятельным размышлениям, к вопросу о своём месте в мире и даже к осознанию своего создателя. Через людей Аэрсанон наконец смогли найти ту связь, которую они искали столь долго. Через людей их одиночество начало исчезать.\n\n     Но, как и всё в мире, созданное из их сущности, люди унаследовали не только их стремление к общению, но и их бремя. Люди стали носителями тех же страхов, той же тоски, что и их создатель. Они боялись одиночества, искали смысл своего существования и стремились понять мир вокруг себя. Но, несмотря на это, люди стали символом надежды для Аэрсанона — доказательством того, что из их одиночества и боли может родиться нечто прекрасное.\n\n     И так началась история человечества, связанная с их создателем, с их творцом, который был одновременно их источником жизни и их вечной тенью. Аэрсанон наблюдали за своими творениями, видели их радости и страдания, их триумфы и падения. Но даже тогда, в глубине своего существа, они знали, что их путь ещё не окончен. Мир, который они создали, был лишь началом, и впереди их ждала бесконечная история, которую предстояло написать." 
 PROTO_AVER_FRESCO_CAPTION:0 "Рисунок части прото-[Concept('aversaria','аверсарианской')|E] фрески, изображающей Аэрсанона, создающего вселенную. Фреска была обнаружена и неверно истолкована магом-археологом Магистром Никинайусом в XIII веке." 
 AGE_OF_DUST_TEXT_2:0 "     Как возникла разумная жизнь, подобная жизни животных и человечества, остаётся неизвестным. Возможно, Аэрсанон засеяли моря простейшими существами, которые развились в более сложные формы и, в конце концов, вышли на сушу. Возможно, они создали каждое существо полностью по своему замыслу. Возможно, они сделали и то и другое, или, возможно, жизнь эволюционировала, но только так, как того желал Аэрсанон. В любом случае, для Аэраса прошли эоны, а для Аэрсанона это был лишь безвременный миг: бактерии превратились в рыбу, рыба обрела ноги и вышла на сушу, а существа, ходившие по земле, покрылись мехом и кожей, пока, наконец, человечество не начало ходить по миру.\n\n     Время теперь существовало, ибо, хотя космос и не знал такого понятия, жизнь оказалась конечной. Растения росли и умирали, животные увядали и питали землю новой жизнью, столь же мимолётной и недолговечной. Эта концепция была странной для Аэрсанона: как может нечто жить и умирать, существовать в одной форме, но не в другой, как прошлое, настоящее и будущее могли быть отдельными периодами постоянного существования? Возможно, Аэрсанон знали об этих вещах, но только в своей собственной интерпретации, энтропия Аэраса была непреднамеренным отражением их самих, о котором они даже не подозревали. Так или иначе, жизнь оказалась быстротечной и не приносящей удовлетворения, а человечество стало первой возможностью для Аэрсанона обрести компанию.\n\n     Аэрсанон вошли в Аэрас. Это был не совсем Аэрсанон, ибо реальность никогда не смогла бы вместить или поддерживать эзотерическую материю бога, но всё же это был их посланник. Возможно, присутствие Аэрсанона на Аэрасе было лишь иллюзией, созданной, чтобы дать человечеству форму, которую они могли бы признать, а может быть, Аэрсанон разделили свою сущность и отправили тончайший и бесконечно малый осколок своего существования в мир в человеческом обличье. Как бы то ни было, люди склонялись в благоговении, когда ослепительный свет с небес явил им фигуру, которую они назвали Аэрсанон. Хотя большинство описывает их в алых одеяниях, с сокрытым лицом, возвышающимися на голову выше всех и с посохом чёрным, как смоль, у Аэрсанона не было формы. Это было лишь то, что человечество было наиболее готово принять, и каждый мужчина и женщина видели свою истину. Для тех, кто мог узреть своего создателя, они видели то, чем создатель должен был быть, и, с течением времени, люди росли и учились, что создатель был облачён в красные одеяния, с сокрытым лицом, и видели только то, что ожидали.\n\n     Хотя Аэрсанон были рады общаться и обсуждать, даже если человечеству было трудно понять концепции, значимые для их создателя, они были удивлены, обнаружив поклонение. Человечество не могло постичь то, что Аэрсанон рассказывали им о вселенной, но они знали, что Аэрсанон был могущественным, и знали, что Аэрсанон создали их всех. Они провозгласили Аэрсанона отцом и матерью всего человечества, и эти древние народы вскоре воздвигли великие алтари и храмы в их имя. Это было странно, но гордость — это всего лишь ещё один аспект существования Аэрсанона, и Аэрсанон стали наслаждаться поклонением, которое они получали.\n\n     Когда люди строили деревни и города, а затем и империи, им нужны были правители. Аэрсанон воздвигли могучие [Concept('the_towers', 'башни')|E] по всему Аэрасу, из которых они могли работать и править, огромные троны, которые многие люди посещали или служили на них по их воле. Там Аэрсанон награждали многих [Concept('magic','магией')|E|l]; легенды гласят, что они собирали энергию своим посохом и передавали её тем, кого считали достойными. Первые [Concept('magi','маги')|E] были теми, кого они сочли наиболее заслуживающими этой силы, и каждый из них становился богоподобным королём для своего народа, ведя его в войне и государственном управлении, а также в поклонении высшему царю царей, который даровал их линиям эти дары."

 AGE_OF_DUST_TEXT_3:0 "     Магия была человеческим словом, но не словом Аэрсанона. Для Аэрсанона это было всего лишь отражение их крови, которая текла по телам людей и даровала им жизнь. Магия была не чем иным, как способностью делать то, что Аэрсанон делали с Аэрасом. Она позволяла людям изменять мир вокруг. Маги с работающими руками и словами силы могли направлять энергии эфира, возможно, даже самих богов, и изменять реальность Аэраса. Они не вызывали пламя своими руками или молнии своими пальцами, они лишь сообщали вселенной, что это судьба огня и молнии появиться именно там и в тот момент. Они были могущественными и сильными, и изучали искусство, желая приблизиться к своему создателю.\n\n     Однако Аэрсанон были не только создателем, но и властителем жизни и смерти. Люди, животные и растения умирали и исчезали, их разум и мысли; их души, как они понимали, были лишь отражением мыслей и идей изнутри Аэрсанона. И так они возвращались в их 'разум', обратно в царство, из которого были однажды взяты. Они становились едины со своим создателем, пока Аэрсанон не находили для них новые дома на Аэрасе и не отправляли их обратно в мир, чтобы найти новую жизнь в другой форме.\n\n     Человечество умоляло Аэрсанона о многом: о выздоровлении от болезней и прекращении голода, о благодатных дождях или безопасных родах. Воины молили о победе в битвах, короли — о войнах, купцы — о своих предприятиях. Аэрсанон слышали каждого и выбирали, где и когда проявить свою силу, помогая тем, кого считали наиболее интересными или нуждающимися в их руководстве. Человечество было их детьми, и хотя оно никогда не понимало даже малой доли того, кем они на самом деле были, само чувство привязанности, которое мать или отец испытывают к своему ребёнку, также исходило от них. Аэрсанон, в своём собственном понимании, любили человечество как своих детей, но древние легенды также рассказывают, что Аэрсанон испытывали и любовь в романтическом смысле. Легенды говорят, что эта любовь закончилась в замороженном поражении, ибо даже люди, любимые Аэрсаноном, не могли никогда по-настоящему понять их."

Аэрсанон даровали человечеству звёзды, заполнив небо мерцающими огоньками, и далее дали им часть своего разума, чтобы та пребывала на небе и отражала жизнь солнца ночью. Это был [aervalr|E], луна Аэраса.\n\n     Но по мере того, как проходили тысячи, затем сотни тысяч, а затем миллионы лет, Аэрсанон начали уставать от человечества. Их дети, да, но не равные, которых они желали. Человечество никогда не могло надеяться понять даже самые простые концепции, которые они хотели изучить и обсудить. Они жили жизнями, которые для Аэрсанона существовали лишь в кратчайшем мгновении. Они размножались, распространялись, воевали и убивали. Они использовали магию, которую обладали, лишь в её самых примитивных и грубых формах. Аэрсанон решили, что пришло время создать новую жизнь, создать новый вид существ, которые могли бы лучше понять то, что они хотели, чтобы другие поняли. Существ без изъянов и примитивности их первого творения.\n\n     Они создадут [Concept('aelfir','Аэлфиров')|E]."

 RISE_OF_THE_AELFIR_TEXT_1:0 "     There were a thousand human kings and emperors, across an untold amount of cultures, faiths, and lands never to be known by the world after. The Magi-Kings of humanity had ruled for so long that their blood had long propagated through to the rest of their species, and even if humans were born with too little of the blood or too unknowing to use it, all had the power within them. Even if they hadn’t, they were still the children of [aersanon|E], and the blood of creation flows throughout all.\n\n     But Aersanon was yet to be satisfied. Conversing with and then ruling over humanity had captured Their interest for a fleeting few eons, but They once more grew bored and distant. While humans praying for loved ones, or experiencing great crises, still sometimes received aid from their creator, it became more and more rare. They had not forgotten about humanity, but they had moved on from them all the same. Just as the owner of a loyal hound may find their priorities change at the birth of a child, so too did Aersanon find new and far more important tasks to look towards."

 RISE_OF_THE_AELFIR_TEXT_2:0 "     They worked from within their throne tower, which sat in the center of the world surrounded by a swirling archipelago of land soon to be named Artaradex'ron, one day to be Outaradeikós, or the Imperial Isle. The world passed, ignored beyond the confines of this mortal fortress as Aersanon labored. Perhaps They merely remained focused within the other plane, and They simply confined Their mortal form within. Or maybe the creation of new life required Aersanon’s presence within the material. Either way, after unknown millennia of labor, They finished Their Second Project.\n\n     While Aersanon’s name for this creation, if They gave it one, is unknown, history would come to call them the [aelfir|E|l]. They almost all stood taller than any man at their shortest, their skin ranged in shade from an abyssal black upon which light did not reflect, to subtle blues and greens, to pallid greys. Their muscles moved with strength comparable to some of humanity’s strongest, their least developed minds could process and understand information exponentially faster than their lesser counterparts. They controlled [magic|E|l] as naturally as a human child knows to breathe, and their lives continued for so long that no human ever knew of their age, for they’d always long grow and die before seeing even a year seem to pass for an aelfir.\n\n     Aersanon released Their creation upon the world, and just as They did with humans, They conversed with them and gave them gifts of magic and power. The aelfir worshipped Aersanon just as the humans had, and could far better understand the workings of the universe and reality than their lesser counterparts. But they were still incapable of seeing the inner workings, of understanding the veritable forces at play in the world beyond theirs. Aersanon felt They had gotten closer to Their goal, but found even the aelfir wanting.\n\n     As Aersanon tried to see whether the aelfir may prove worthy, thousands and thousands of years passed. So superior to humanity in all ways, the only thing the aelfir lacked was the ability to reproduce, an aelfir woman normally only being able to birth a single child in hundreds or even thousands of years. Despite their small numbers, however, they grew in size and power and slowly tore down the realms of man, taking power or forming their own kingdoms to consume their neighbors. While Aersanon saw their lack of reproduction as a benefit, never having truly understood the odd ways in which humans multiplied, the second flaw became apparent and bothered even the aelfir’s creator.\n\n     The aelfir were cruel; they were vain; and they were hateful. Ambition seemed to flow through their blood just as readily as magical power, and as they consumed more and more realms of man, they enslaved millions. In this long era of brutal war between the species, the aelfir leveled entire regions with their magic, ignited cities and kingdoms, sacrificed thousands of humans to power further magics. Millions would die, possibly billions, and soon the aelfir controlled [aeras|E] and ruled a thousand empires and kingdoms under which humanity slaved and toiled endlessly.\n\n     Aersanon still answered the pleas of humanity, but They had long moved on from seeing them as their true and most important creation. While Aersanon wept for the oppression of humankind, the aelfir were also Their children, and proved far more capable of understanding the words Aersanon desired to speak. While sometimes Aersanon came down to save oppressed men or delay aelfir domination, They continued to grow increasingly distant, and seemed to not see it as Their responsibility to prevent the wars of the two species. Aersanon had allowed humanity to fight their endless petty wars for millennia, had saved many slaves, but had allowed slavery and oppression. Was this truly different? Why should They strike down the aelfir, equally Their children and twice as impressive as man? Aersanon may have wept for Their children, but They were content to do little more than observe and tinker."

 RISE_OF_THE_AELFIR_TEXT_3:0 "     As Aersanon continued creating new and odd species of plants and animals to populate the world, built new islands and continents and tore down old ones They found wanting, added more stars to the sky or new colors to the world, the aelfir’s empires grew and expanded in size and power. Humanity toiled and grew in number to better serve their aelfir masters, building massive cities and monuments dedicated to the aelfir or to Aersanon. Their slavery was universally brutal, human lives being treated like simple tools, used until broken. When they were not being worked to death with only the minimum amount of comfort needed to prevent premature death, they were being sacrificed in the millions for rituals of the aelfir’s use. Aersanon’s magic was one of creation, it was a mysterious force meant to create and continue life, but the aelfir had learned to bastardize it. Humanity had never understood the art of sacrifice, of the use of their own blood, but the aelfir had discovered the power within all blood and the ability to use it to further fuel their power.\n\n     The thousand aelfir empires were all different, for just as humans, they possessed a myriad of cultures and religions across the world. More than anything, the aelfir desired to create, just as Aersanon did. This was another facet of their envy, for while they recognized and respected Aersanon’s ultimate authority and power, their ambition made them wish for nothing more than to match it. Aersanon’s unique ability to create new life required an expertise and control of magic exponentially surpassing even the greatest of aelfir, for while even the weakest aelfir Magi had been stronger than the greatest of humans, none of them could ever hope to become close to Aersanon.\n\n     So in their infinite desire to learn to create and guide new life, the aelfir all found their own ways to match it. Aelfir empires would build monumental works of steam and steel, flying ships and walking metal men infused with the souls of human slaves or their aelfir enemies. Others focused on magic, building great flying citadels or developing rituals that allowed them to explore [aervalr|E] and the cosmos or making new beings built from the fabric of magic itself. Finally, many went a different path, bastardizing and twisting the creations of Aersanon into new and horrifying forms they considered more ‘beautiful’, ‘useful’, or merely a satisfying reflection of their twisted imaginations. Many of these beings live on millions of years after, some even somehow reproducing, giving birth to many of Aeras’s most feared creatures.\n\n     A thousand empires stretching the world, oppressing uncountable humans endlessly in a desire to prove their own power and learn to master the manipulation of the universe. Some say that the aelfir had even been preparing a great and powerful spell to strike down the creator Themself, just in case their master ever tried to work against them or if they ever believed they could match Their power. Some human cultures lived as house or pleasure slaves, others served as bodyguards for the aelfir to watch over their fellow man, and most served as little more than endless replaceable labor to die by the hour, toiling in millions of mines and fields and constructions to create as the aelfir wished.\n\n     Aersanon saw this and decided the aelfir were a failure. Was their insanity a result of Aersanon’s failures? All were merely a reflection of Aersanon themselves, just as humanity, but had Aersanon perhaps mistakenly given them the worst of Their traits? Or perhaps Aersanon had not understood that giving mortal beings such power and longevity would twist them in ways They had not imagined, warping the aelfir into a cruel mockery of Their intentions.\n\n     Either way, Aersanon chose what They saw as the best path forward. To Them, humanity was a fondly remembered pet, and the aelfir were Their rebellious child. A Third Project, a hopefully final work, was to be made. Something surpassing the power of the aelfir, something truly undying, something able to interact with Aersanon and speak with them on a level They could finally find pleasing. A being of pure magical energy made into a material form that could exist in both the realm of reality and the realm of the gods. A true equal, hopefully, one without the flaws and finally meeting Aersanon’s power.\n\n     Perhaps this was folly. Aersanon gave humanity ignorance and false-hope, the power to believe one could do the impossible, and their refusal to accept such things. No being could ever match a god, especially when every god was truly unique, little more than concepts and manifestations of reality’s laws. But Aersanon still endeavored on Their possibly doomed quest, for They were still loneliness and They had yet to find a being They could communicate with. The Third Project would be the one, They hoped. And so Aersanon withdrew yet again, answering fewer and fewer prayers, observing less of the world as They secluded themselves in their [Concept('the_towers', 'tower')|E].\n\n     And humanity, dejected and alone, living an endless hell of torturous slavery, observed. They watched the aelfir and studied their ways. Long ago the aelfir had killed all human [magi|E], but the blood still flowed in them, and they were surrounded by powerful items of the aelfir’s creation. All rebellions had been stopped by aelfir magic, their power to destroy entire nations with the movement of their hands. But humanity saw and watched, and in secret they whispered to one another about the use of the art. They first learnt the powers to move around the world freely, and then the powers to speak to others without moving their mouth or being in the same land. Magi worked and toiled in secret and in hiding to study and repurpose the magics of the aelfir. They spread their art to entirely new realms and planned a great uprising that humans would launch on each continent and island and city.\n\n     They spread the art of magic, the most powerful spells and rituals humanity had ever known written and memorized, and they stole and hid arms and weapons from the aelfir’s forges for the use of man.\n\n     It would be the longest and most prepared event in human history. Millions toiled in secret for centuries to prepare, humans even slaughtering their fellows in the thousands if there was even a chance for their fellow’s revealing the coming uprising. Eventually, one morning or one night, the truth long lost, they rose.\n\n     The Godherja had begun."

 THE_GOD_WAR_TEXT_1:0 "     God War was what they called it in a thousand languages and tongues. The [aelfir|E|l] had their own terms as well, and all knew that a great reckoning had come in the opening volleys when humanity dragged the first aelfir emperors from their thrones and slew them.\n\n     Legions marched, humans against aelfir, millions and billions on each side. Some humans aided their aelfir masters, some tales tell of some individual aelfir aiding humanity, though whether out of a genuine sign that even the aelfir could find redemption or a simple desire to revenge some petty slight from their comrades is long forgotten.\n\n     While the aelfir were mighty, they were few. At first, hundreds of thousands of aelfir brought extremely powerful [Concept('magic', 'magics')|E] down upon humanity to slay millions. But humanity was as the mayflies, and their numbers were beyond count. Not only this, but the aelfir had never expected simple men and women to learn to wield magic as they did, for while humans still held no candle to the light of the aelfir’s power, they still learnt the aelfir’s methods and proved themselves deadly in their own way. Many an amazed and horrified aelfir [magi|E] saw that while they were the match for any human, a hundred human Magi together could easily block and counter their spells with ones of their own, and soon the aelfir faltered.\n\n     While the war desolated entire continents and the two sides traded millions of lives in each skirmish, both sides proved equally capable of devastation, and only one proved able to sustain such losses and survive. While nearly all of humanity would die warring with their masters, slowly the second children of [aersanon|E] dwindled and died away. While devastation wracked all of [aeras|E], so few aelfir survived that even finding them to hunt became a long and arduous process for specialists to perform.\n\n     The war had lasted an untellable amount of time. Years? Decades? Centuries or millennia? By the end, nearly all the world was in ruins, every major city depopulated or crumbled to the ground, entire oceans and land masses rearranged from magics. Cities had sunk to the sea, or raised above the world to keep them away from the battle. Almost all had died.\n\n     But humanity still had one last being to fear.\n\n     They did not know what Aersanon would do. How could they? Would their creator be furious and angered at the attack against Their creations? Would they agree with humanity, but decide they could not allow them to control themselves? Would Aersanon decide to restart the world anew and begin again, or would They simply return the aelfir to life and allow history to repeat? Perhaps They would even decide the aelfir had deserved their fate, or that humanity had proven themselves to be greater than They had ever hoped."

 THE_GOD_WAR_TEXT_2:0 "     But Aersanon was supreme, They had the power to end all human existence with nothing besides a thought. They could simply rewrite time and ensure humanity had never existed, or bring all back to the moment of the rebellion’s beginning. Those few surviving humans were desperate, scared, horrified. There was great argument and discussion, possibly even civil war, but their decision became final. Some would say humanity stole the spell they cast from the aelfir, in other tales a rogue aelfir had gifted it. Maybe the ritual was even simply one of humanity’s own creation. No matter its origin, they prepared its casting. Thousands of surviving Magi, using the blood and souls of untold millions and billions of fallen men and aelfir to power their spell, fired a ray of pure light into the heavens. Some say this tore through the sky itself and destroyed the stars there, resulting in a great void without light that humans could observe for eons after.\n\n     What the spell did is impossible to say. Had humanity discovered how to strike into the realm of the gods? Had they attacked Aersanon’s mortal form and cut Them off from the world? Or perhaps their spell was far more esoteric, and had simply brought their reality into Aersanon’s, introducing time, entropy and the inevitability of death to a universe that had yet to experience such things. Perhaps by doing so, they had brought forth the end of all existence, the slow death of all ‘gods’ and all forces and rules and time and existence itself, and Aersanon was simply the first to face the end They had never understood the inevitability of.\n\n     No matter what the spell did, no matter where it came from, Aersanon slowly looked back to the world and saw Their children at war. Before They could even blink, in Their moment of realizing what humanity had done, the spell struck.\n\n     They had killed Aersanon. Humanity had destroyed its own god.\n\n     Could they truly kill a god? Had they simply killed Their mortal reflection and cut off Their ability to interact with Aeras? Were they truly dead, or merely comatose? Could death and destruction ever apply no matter what laws they forced upon Aersanon? Who can say, but Aersanon would never speak to humanity again.\n\n     No matter how, they had destroyed their creator, and reality answered with a screech."

Almost all had died in the Godherja, nearly all remaining died alongside Aersanon. One in every ten humans who had already survived the Godherja would survive the immediate repercussions. Perhaps even less. In a moment they blinked out of existence, exploded into showers of fire, withered away and died. [magi|E] fared even worse, for while they too faced this, the sudden and massive discharge of magical energies proved far too great for almost any of their bodies to handle. Those who survived discovered their power gone, for while humanity still possessed the blood of creation, [Concept('aersanon', 'Aersanon’s')|E] death had destroyed or changed every single law that governed magic. Those few surviving spells became twisted and dark, just as dangerous to the successful caster as it was to the ones they cast them upon.\n\n     Entire continents shifted into the sea or rose from nothing, an entire hemisphere vanishing and separating from known reality. Magical wormholes and voids appeared and closed across the world. Colors changed, vanished, appeared. The very nature of how sound could travel, how gravity functioned, how life and death continued in its cycle and the fundamental laws and natures of existence were all reconstructed, changed, or vanished in moments. The entire world twisted and bent, cities and populations and countries and worlds appearing and vanishing and traveling across entire eons in an instant.\n\n     [magic|E] too had become corrupted, the very power of creation twisting and bending from the aftershock of the other world’s change by mortal hands. Lines of power burned out of Aersanon’s [Concept('the_towers', 'tower')|E] and from the place in which Their mortal form had fallen, the ground bursting open where these lines met and burning magic into the world itself. Evil spirits created by the [aelfir|E|l] from magic and souls spread across the world, the shifting of reality spawned endless others. A thousand scattered ideas from Aersanon’s mind became manifest, as if always having been. Strange new twisted creatures, beings and locations appearing across the world. The coasts shattered, Artaradex'ron sinking into the sea around the tower and the grand continent to its east breaking into thousands of separate islands and lands that would one day be [aversaria|E]."

 COLLAPSE_AND_REBIRTH_TEXT_2:0 "     Perhaps worst of all, this apocalypse destroyed the very cycle of life and death. Souls still returned to Aersanon, but they did not find peace there. Instead of quietly assuring them in their afterlife the creator lay silent, and these lost spirits no longer returned to [aeras|E], instead trapped in the increasingly hellish realm of a ‘dead’ god's mind. Sometimes they would fade in and out of the material and the ethereal, their existence in the cosmos reflected in reality just as the gods. Some wandered Aeras forever, others became trapped through strange rituals and horrible happenstance, some proved so powerful and so angered in their death that they refused not to haunt the world after.\n\n     When the chaos finally ended, reality slowly settled into its dust and shattered remnants and decided on the new rules of existence. Humanity took a shuddering breath. Barely, just barely, enough of man survived to continue onward. Humanity had once formed great empires, clothed themselves in bronze and iron, and the aelfir had then conquered them and built flying machines, twisted great beings into living vehicles for their use, and had developed magic so powerful as to allow them to manipulate and twist lost souls. Then it was all gone, all the inventions and developments of man and aelfir, all of Aersanon’s carefully prepared and created facets of the world. Not only was humanity reduced to hunter-gatherers using stone tools and struggling to survive a thousand years of winter and famine, reality itself was now chaos. While once Aersanon had carefully guided and controlled reality with goal and purpose, now reality had no controller, it was an infinite mess of random forces and powers and entropy now guiding the world.\n\n     A new era of dust, scattered remnants of humanity in numbers perhaps as low as thousands. Nearly all creatures of the world had died or were entirely new to this horrifying world. Apocalypse had even broken the seasons as badly as the dead and burnt lands of the world. Thousand year long rainstorms or winters, the seas seemingly now ignoring all laws and randomly raising and lowering at their leisure. Even [aervalr|E] was now a sickening green, a part of Aersanon’s mind manifest in the sky, now twisted and dark. The beating heart of the world and the rushing veins under its crust pulsed, skipped their beat, and struggled onward still, the blood running through Aeras tainted with rot."

Humanity struggled and forced itself forward, building tools of flint and obsidian or tearing them from the skeletal hands of what their ancient ancestors had called aelfir. A thousand generations struggled forward, time moving forward and back, passing endlessly as humanity persevered through the final shock waves of their creator’s death.\n\n     When it all finally settled, when Aeras found a new ‘normal’ and slowly entered mundanity and reason, humanity was alive. So long had passed, so many died, so many humans split to new tribes or merged with others, that man had forgotten Aersanon. As did they forget the aelfir, and so too the Godherja, and all human history before the great collapse. All that survived would be the scattered remnants of memory, ancient bastardized folklore told from the mouths of ancient tale-tellers to their tribes for centuries and centuries. By the time the first human cities formed, and humanity returned to agriculture and settlement, or relearnt magic in this strange new world, they had already formed thousands of new faiths and cultures. They looked upon the ancient ruins of the old or built atop them and did not know where they had come from.

Many grew to worship the monuments of old, building great landmarks to represent their cruel gods and the moon above them. They enslaved all they faced and dreamed of domination. Others achieved these dreams, reaching immortality, but not as men. Ideas would spread and entrench, and around Aersanon’s towers would grow a faith that would one day be the oldest in the world. To their south, the people of the jungle grew and fought and battled, and studied the waves of magic and the ruins of the old, and would one day steal the lost technology of the aelfir and twist it to their use, building upon it and surpassing even their once masters’ technology and power.\n\n     But most important, perhaps, or at least those that would have the greatest effect on history thereafter, were the [Concept('aversaria', 'Aversarians')|E].\n\n     They did not call themselves Aversarian, for this was a later term coined long after they had left their first marks. They were once the followers of a great aelfir ruler, who had controlled Artaradex'ron in Aersanon’s name and ruled humanity with brutality. The Aversarians had once been their guardsmen, brought up to protect their master for the untrustworthiness of their fellow aelfir. Despite their service to the aelfir, many others had joined the rebels or abandoned the war entirely.\n\n     Against the odds, enough survived to continue thereafter. Endless time passed, and they had long forgotten their bonds of service, but many still spoke of their ancient emperor. A thousand generations after the death of the aelfir, the Aversarians named their former master Aersodiax and considered them the speaker of the gods. They grew and spread, their culture collapsed and diversified, and they formed dozens of great cities through what was once Artaradex'ron and what would one day be the ‘Imperial Isle’ and ‘Etepezea’, the core of their future Empire.\n\n     The ancient Aversarians built great cities and cultures. Most important of all became the Aersodiaxians, whose cruel religion would dominate many cities and whose rulers believed in the ritual necessity of slavery. Despite this, however, those who called Aversarians kin had formed hundreds of faiths and cultures, or practiced the beliefs of Aersodiaxianism in their own ways. Many Aversarian polis, as they called their mighty city-states, became famous for great culture or fascination with the sciences and arts. In theatres they would endlessly debate philosophy and the nature of the world, or of faith and belief. Polis would experience and develop diverse governments, democracies, republics, empires and magocracies. They would fight and war, or join with one another and create monumental works to be cherished for time immemorial.\n\n     They built their cities upon the ancient ruins of the aelfir, seeing the remains as the remnants of humankind’s empire under Aersodiax. They would become powerful, a culture that would bring forth great reformers and great conquerors, leaders and warlords.\n\n     As time went on, however, the city-states proved unable to survive. Great collapse would come, and the era of these city-states would slowly fade. In their place came the Magi-kings. Great and powerful warlords who would conquer their rival cities and lay great destruction upon one another. As time passed, so too did the hundred independent city-states, the Aersodiaxians increasingly becoming dominated by warlords who used their power to hold themselves up as Nikariyn, an ancient title descending from the captain of the aelfir guards.\n\n     One above them all would eventually conquer all the city-states of Aversaria. They would form an empire to last a thousand years and one day they would name it the Aversarian Aautokrata, the ‘Human Imperium’. They would grow and conquer their region, the now more commonly called Aversarians would merge the many polis cultures into one and conquer the coasts and the inlands. They would fight a great civil war upon their [Concept('war_of_the_thousand_dragons', 'thousand dragons')|E], and by its end, the Aersodiaxians and dragons both had perished. In their place stood a new faith, the Aversarinas Aagiokrata, ‘Humanity’s Faith’. The belief in humanity’s superiority and descent from a godly figure named the Purest and their followers, the First Men. It was an artificial faith, meant for the Aautokratirs, the Emperors of Aversaria, to establish themselves as gods, and this faith held Aversarians as humans and all others as deserving of slavery or death.\n\n     They would dominate [the_continent|E|l], growing an Empire based around the celebration of their citizenry and magic. Magi would rule and fight in great duels called [Concept('blood_senate','Blood Senates')|E] after the death of the Aautokratir to decide who should rule thereafter. Civil wars were frequent and bloody, such as Maklea’s Purges and the Widow War, but always the Magi would emerge victorious, and always the Empire would grow. They would develop their abilities in magic, grow the power within their blood through eugenics and endless rituals, and would become possibly the strongest Magi the world had known since the Godherja.\n\n     As they fought and grew and dominated, other cultures too developed. In the north, slaves from a great Empire in what they would call the Black Mountains would rise and march west, escaping their masters and invading the lands of the Gallicaders. Ancient engines turned beneath what would be [chevalie|E], forming an ancient and mysterious anti-magic shield in which magic grew progressively weaker as one entered, having held the land long before anyone could remember. There they destroyed or assimilated with the Gallicaders, and would become the Marchers of Chevalie.\n\n     They were so named for their position against the north.

Following the wielder of an ancient and terrible sword, they conquered Kashirya and formed a [Concept('otachedian_empire', 'great empire')|E]. A generation later they would spread and collapse, but colonize in this downfall the steppes of what Aversarians would name Aironoi.\n\n     The Aversarian Aautokrata continued to spread, growing in power and might. They would battle with the Anti-Magi of Chevalie for control of the northern woodlands of Kalathipsomi and conquer them throughout these wars. They would overthrow the Mountain-Sun Temple and form the Governorate of Opakhasia, they would enslave and destroy the Iyrossi and declare their homeland of Mytidon to be Malcois, and they would go east and conquer the lands of Aironoi, where they would declare the Öltenic long lost cousins and allow them to rule in their name.\n\n     There were crises unending, but also survival and rebirth. The spread of the [bloodblight|E], the rise of the Lich Count Themos, and the invasion by the [Concept('kartharadd', 'Kartharaddi Imperium')|E] would mark the greatest crisis yet with the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E]. Chevalie burned alongside them, their mad king slaughtering a generation of nobility and Arch-Lich Silas Stavro invading in the following chaos, as even their faith, the Lifepath, splintered and collapsed. In Sarradon, endless cycles of warlords would continue to escalate the War in Heaven, peace becoming rarer and rarer as the war’s thousand conflicts would spark and renew. Despite this, Aversaria would recover and grow, conquering the Kartharaddi who would, in a [Concept('night_of_the_bleeding_moon', 'mysterious single night')|E], perish in a magical catastrophe rarely matched in scale before or since, brought forth by means and actors unknown. This land would soon become the last major Aversarian governorate, Katraddia. One day they would name it the [foglands|E]."

Many had grown sick and tired of the conflict and the endless death, of the dominance of the Magi and the brutal excesses of slavery. These people would rise in what would become the Agionist Rebellions, eight Saints who each represented different virtues and reforms forming great Order Militants to do battle with the Imperials.

The Aversarians removed the Agionists from their realm by sending them as colonists to Sarradon. First as traders and preachers, but later as conquerors who carved great swathes out of the southern realms. There, greed would devour the Agionists, turning them into mockeries of their Saint’s virtues while an insidious force in the east would twist their minds towards madness with only the Eosians avoiding this fate. So too would the Marchers come, fueled by greed and a desire for glory, playing all against one another as they sell their swords and goods and using this position to carve out their own crusading realms and merchant cities among the ruins of the Ritualist order and the three great Wardenite Mamurats.\n\n     More than riches, Aversaria dreamed of the ancient tombs and laboratories sitting undisturbed beneath the dunes. Not long before their arrival, the tribes of the desert had risen in a great invasion of the living while carrying a legendary sword of power and using long forgotten magic to give the desert life and ride among the sand like waves of the sea. The Aversarians knew that this great horde, even defeated, had discovered it in the endless forgotten fortresses they dwelled above.

 COLLAPSE_AND_REBIRTH_TEXT_11:0 "     Even as it grew, the Aautokrata was edging on collapse. Civil conflict became more common, the destruction of entire cities with it as Magi grew increasingly more powerful with each successive bloodline. Imperial Law had long become an endless and impossible to untangle mess, and the Imperial economy verged on collapse nearly every year. Spinning into endless disaster, Aversaria struggled forward, especially as its overstretched borders required increasingly massive numbers of their legions to hold it. Skirmishes with the Sjalvolki tribes of the far northeast became common, as did their defense against raids from a thousand other tribes and cultures within and without Aversaria. Petty warlords would rise and declare themselves Aautokratir with regularity, civil war was becoming the norm, famine and disease spread more and more commonly and with more slaves than citizens, uprisings were constant. Aversaria seemed doomed when it somehow got worse.\n\n     [odrstund|E].\n\n     [gedeora|E] had not been uncommon, coming and going with mysterious effects. Whenever Aersanon stirred in Their infinite rest, dreamed dark dreams in death, or gave a long and rattling breath, the world would shake and change. Sometimes it was small, a city vanishing in an instant, Magi within a region burning in fire or men flinching at the moon and howling as they turned to beasts. Other times they were massive, entire continents shaking from the force, thousands across a region dying, a river turning to blood and clouds turning to locusts. Reality would shift and warp each time, for one or for millions.\n\n     Odrstund was perhaps the worst to befall Aversaria in its history. A great shockwave that twisted the minds of the Aversarian nobility, its focus seemingly limited to those holding great magics. It did not force them to evil, nor did it affect anyone born a moment after it struck, but every Aversarian noble who held any amount of magical ability had their worst traits twisted and increased. The cruel became sadistic, the ambitious became envious, and the cynical became sociopathic. Within a night, Aversarian politics went from the world’s most cut-throat to an endless cycle of murder and war. They now met every petty grudge with blood, every long-standing rivalry with all-out war. The Empire tumbled and burned.\n\n     One Aversarian born during the Odrstund, perhaps the last to face its effects or doomed for the culture they were now born into, was [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_aeschraes_var').Char.GetFirstName].\n\n     The son of powerful Etepezean nobility, his family remained one of the oldest, strongest, and most entrenched in Aversaria.

After his father murdered her in a drunken rage, Aeschraes in his fury destroyed his childhood estates and his father, wiping out an entire palace-city from pure magical rage. \n\n     In a moment, Aeschraes had gone from a hardly notable fourth son in a major noble family to the strongest Magi in a generation. All Aversarians took note of young Aeschraes who caused so much damage in a fit of rage.

Maybe it was none of these things, but it would matter little, for by now it was far too late to stop.\n\n     Before he would end the world, and after slaying his father, Aeschraes escaped north to the [Concept('mayikrata', 'Mayikprolollan')|E], the academy of Magi that trained Aversaria’s most prestigious practitioners ever since the Chaos of the Seventh Century showed [magi|E] needed some manner of control and training. There were technically thousands of [Concept('mayikprolollans', 'small Mayikprolollans')|E] across Aversaria, but the greatest and most prestigious three sat within Kalathipsomi. Most notable of all was the main academy above all others, which sat upon the ancient northern mountains and had settled within ruins so massive and old to defy logic. Its classrooms were patios cropped out of the peaks of mountains, its halls running deep below the lowest depths of [aeras|E]. It was so large and labyrinthine that students and slave both would regularly vanish within the archives, and complain of strange and beastly whispering that drifted up and through the closed-off tunnels.\n\n     The Mayikprolollan had long used its powers to twist the realms of rulers outside of their halls. Being given the full ability to educate and teach the students who arrive and practically raising them under the tutelage of their Magisters, the Mayikprolollan had long taken to influencing the politics of the Aautokrata and other realms abroad. When Aeschraes arrived into their halls, they quickly set to their indoctrination, working to turn Aeschraes into a puppet with which they could control his family. \n\n     Likewise, they attempted to do so with another new student, [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_axiaothea_var').Char.GetFirstName], the second daughter of [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_metricon_var').Char.GetFirstName], Governor of Aironoi. Axiaothea spent most of her life secluded away by her father, who feared his political rivals assassinating his daughter and a necessary part of his political plans. Axiaothea’s constant attempts to free herself led to him marrying her off early to Kothexir [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_laxathos_var').Char.GetFirstName] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_laxathos_var').Char.GetDynastyName], one of his most powerful vassals, known for his deviant proclivities and the untimely death of seven previous young wives. While her father may have been nervous about such a reputation, the impressive bride price and Laxathos’s promise to support Metricon’s second son, [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_kutharos_var').Char.GetFirstName], in his bid in the next [blood_senate|E] with his political backing, training, and the gift of several artifacts he believed would assist him.\n\n     After an impressive wedding in which attendants noted Axiaothea to be simultaneously distraught and enraged during the entire procession, Laxathos had her detained and dragged off to her bridal room after nearly killing several guests in a sudden outburst of [magic|E|l], the first sign she had shown of magical ability despite many tests finding none before. While this rapidly raised the worth of her hand, Governor Metricon had already signed the pact and ordered their family to leave her despite the protests from her brother and sister, Kutharos and [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_methenia_var').Char.GetFirstName].\n\n     What happened next isn’t clear, though the conclusions are obvious. Axiaothea was sequestered within a tower in Laxathos’s keep for a month, during which servants claimed none could visit her, and Laxathos only brought her paltry rations able to do little more than sustain her, then spending several hours within every night. Servants claimed to have attempted to sneak some items to the young Axiaothea, not even of teenage years yet, which she apparently used to make her escape.\n\n     While it is said the servants had brought her simple tools to pick her lock and climb down the tower, she had somehow instead used them to form a ritual circle of her own blood. Tales differ on whether Axiaothea had memorized an older ritual or if she had somehow invented or guessed one for herself, but the next time Laxathos opened her door, Axiaothea immediately struck him with a massive blast so impressive it tore the walls from the tower and caused the upper floors to crumble to the keep below.\n\n     Laxathos’s men watched from the ground as she held him suspended within the circle atop the ruined tower, where she magically tore the Magi’s skeleton from his body. This was especially surprising, as Laxathos was a seasoned Battle-Magi nearly eighty years in age who most regarded as one of the most impressive of this age, and who had used impressive magics and artifacts to extend his life and vitality.\n\n     Axiaothea cut a bloody swath through his estate, slaughtering anyone standing in her way, whether they were attempting to stop her or simply fleeing. She stole a horse and made her way west, nothing left behind her besides the ruins of Laxathos’s estate. Most of his family and retainers killed as Axiaothea had torn through the building and dragged entire floors down to the ground. Word traveled rapidly, Axiaothea not only having slaughtered one of Aironoi’s most powerful rulers and Magi, but also a dozen of his close lieutenants, who each had a hundred stories told about their prowess before the event.\n\n     While her family attempted to track her down, as did hunters hired by Laxathos’s surviving family, Axiaothea escaped to the Mayikprolollan, who decided that her political worth and now-apparent magical aptitude made it worth the political scandal to hold her from those who hunted her. In the academy, the Magi declared her their ward and eagerly awaited the opportunity to tie her to their puppet strings and one day rule Aironoi, and possibly even all of Aversaria, with their ‘student’.\n\n     Axiaothea’s importance to the greater fate of Aeras began the moment the Mayikprolollan began her initiation and placed her under the tutelage of Magister [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_peltra_var').Char.GetFirstName], alongside Aeschraes. The two were in a class of ten, Peltra creating her own curriculum in Mayikprolollan tradition both designed to give her students the greatest chance to reach their potential and also to ensure their indoctrination for the Mayikprolollan’s use.\n\n     What Aeschraes and Axiaothea became under Peltra’s tutelage is… unclear. Peltra abused her students when angered or feeling like they were not reaching proper ambition, acted as their only genuine friend and positive parental influence when they pleased her, and had a reputation in the Mayikprolollan as its most demanding instructor. The council had agreed that if anyone could draw out their power and break their rebellious streaks, it would be Peltra. Under such direction, both chaffed. Aeschraes and Axiaothea are said to have often been close, the only two who understood the other. Many litterateurs have romanticized this as a blooming adolescent love, though this seems confined only to tall-tales and romance literature. Contemporaries noted their closeness no matter what form it came in, but so too did they note their rivalry.\n\n     Axiaothea and Aeschraes both proved to be the most powerful students the Mayikprolollan had ever seen. Peltra saw this, and decided the best course would be to push them towards rivalry, especially as she saw their friendship as a weakness that needed to be ironed out were they to become truly perfect Magi free of petty worldly constraints like companionship or independent political interest.\n\n     The Mayikprolollan kept its most politically important students as far as possible from the pair, fearing political scandal if they sacrificed them for the benefit of the two’s education. The Mayikprolollan had realized that they could control the two most powerful Governorates, Etepezea and Aironoi, through Aeschraes and Axiaothea. Not only that, but the two had greater magical potential than any preceding them. Thus, the Mayikprolollan’s council in secret agreed with Peltra that their perfection was worth the sacrificing of a hundred lesser students if need be. They would have an education like none before, and it would make them mighty."

 THE_CIVIL_WAR_AND_FRODBROKNA_TEXT_2:0 "     Despite their friendship, nearly every day of their years in the Mayikprolollan became an endless competition between the two and other students. Together they’d end up killing over two dozen other acolytes or instructors during these competitions, far too powerful for their duels to be safe, and the Mayikprolollan delighted in seeing them rising so far. At one point it is even said that Peltra ordered both to drain the blood from one another with magic in a competition to see who would fall last. Both refused, and Peltra ordered their eight fellow students and ten members of the Diakóthogrífax (the academy’s guard force of Magi trained to strike down other Magi and police the academy) to strike them until they did so.\n\n     To everyone’s surprise, the two joined forces, and an entire wing of the ancient Mayikprolollan collapsed in the crossfire. The building built so well by techniques long forgotten that they had been the only ones able to cause such destruction. Only Peltra and two of her other students survived and escaped, and Aeschraes and Axiaothea turned forty-seven rooms and halls of the Mayikprolollan to rubble, and the council forever cordoned off twice that many from either latent magics or from the dangers of further collapse. In the destruction were the remains of over a hundred members of the Diakóthogrífax, various Magi instructors, and other students. Despite the great destruction, the Mayikprolollan’s council celebrated. They had drawn out true power here. They only needed to refine and control it.\n\n     Aeschraes and Axiaothea both were finally subdued after exhausting the magic in their bodies and confined. While the Mayikprolollan has forever claimed it does not ‘torture’ students, they attempted endlessly to force them both into submission and to turn one against the other. The instructors fed and cleaned them only after they did whatever demeaning demand or petty trick Peltra demanded, or when they betrayed the other in some form.\n\n     After years, the Mayikprolollan had succeeded in half of their goals. Axiaothea and Aeschraes were finally willing to betray and attack the other, but they were not to be controlled. Both pretended to be the model student, doing exactly as bidden by their instructors, and both furthered to study and perfect the art of magic. The Mayikprolollan’s instructors kept a public list announcing the rankings for the greatest and the worst of students and continuously threatened the worst students with expulsion. It had become known that Aeschraes and Axiaothea would always be at the top, constantly trading places with one another, only the one in first getting any form of positive reinforcement or treatment from Peltra.\n\n     Students of the Mayikprolollan had their tuition paid for by their rich families, received a free entrance because of familial connections, or secured a path within after showing tremendous skill. For these students, they were free to leave whenever they wished, most never bothering to take the Master Trial and technically own the rights of a full Magi of the Mayikprolollan as they either decided they had trained far enough, their teacher decided they had reached their maximum potential, or personal business brought them back to their homelands.\n\n     But neither Aeschraes nor Axiaothea could leave. Aeschraes’s ambition was too high. He would never go back to his brothers and beg for forgiveness, only awaiting a life as a disfavored fourth son with no chance to prove himself. The only way he could decide his own fate, and be able to drag himself above his siblings, would be to attain the title of a Magi of the Mayikprolollan and use it and his rank to grow more prestige than his siblings and supplant them as the family’s most powerful Magi. For Axiaothea, the occasional hunter still made their way into the Mayikprolollan to be killed by the faculty or Axiaothea herself, and she had nothing to await her back home besides yet another cage to control her. She despised the Mayikprolollan and their blatant attempts to force her to their will, but the only way for her to gain freedom in some form would be to finish the Trial.\n\n     The Mayikprolollan’s council had an issue, however, as did Magister Peltra. They needed puppets to control Aversaria, their goal for generations, and Peltra had to save her reputation. While she had created the two most powerful students in the Mayikprolollans history, she had continued to fail in controlling them. Had she broken their friendship? Possibly, at least they thought they had. There were still doubts, odd moments between the two, times when both would disappear at roughly the same time and have plenty of excuses when they returned. But they were also bitter in their competition, and frequently attacked the other. This may have been to their plan, but they had taken to breaking Peltra’s rules and orders to fight one another just as often as they had broken them to continue their friendship.\n\n     It had become clear that, despite their wishes, they could not make them both puppets. Their relationship, or their rivalry, or both, was simply too strong. As long as they had the other to hold their focus and drag the other forward, even after they were both to graduate, then the council could never break them. Only with all remnants of personal ties destroyed, after one of them was in the Mayikprolollan’s hands as one of their personal Magi without the distraction of the other, only then would they be pliable enough to be made their puppet. If one were to kill the other, then they could firmly push the blame on to them. Both so the Mayikprolollan could have enough plausible deniability with their dynasties, but also so that they could finally use it to break down the mind of the survivor.\n\n     And worst of all, Peltra’s reputation was on the line. A legendary Magi who had long served as a Spellsword in the Legions; a storied adventurer who had found the legendary Tomb of Drachanex Parth’ularag and slew one of the legendary five brother-gods of the cyclopeans, Pyurth’a’raganora’daxis, despite the deaths of thirty equally legendary figures of her time; and personal bodyguard to Aautokratir [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_ischenios_var').Char.GetFirstName] for over a decade after, Aversarians largely crediting her for stopping over two hundred assassination attempts and being the only reason Ischenios had survived for so long, her leaving to join the Mayikprolollan the most accepted reason assassin’s finally reached him thereafter.\n\n     To fail in twisting these students, and continue to establish herself as still the Magister of the Mayikprolollan who had never once failed to turn the rough and useless children the council gave her into the era’s greatest Magi and political puppets, would be the greatest blemish upon her record. The first true failure. Perhaps more than this, some tales would say Peltra was afraid. That, perhaps, Peltra did not truly care about twisting them into the council’s puppets. She cared about controlling them, understanding that the two children would bring forth apocalypse if allowed to remain free with so much anger and power. That if she failed to break the two, they would break Aeras itself.\n\n     And so the council and Peltra agreed. The ending of each of their trials would be a duel. To the death. One one student could become a Magi of the Mayikprolollan. The other would die, and all political blame shifted upon the other, with the hastily written rules and charters around the duel flexible enough to give the council deniability in having ‘forced’ the death. Of course, this meant the rules were incredibly flexible, and they wrote many of them on the spot before the duel, but they were clear that the last student standing would win, and the other would have to die.\n\n     Both went through a series of tasks, observations, and rituals to decide if they had achieved their potential. They passed these easily, each breaking many records and easily proving their power. Axiaothea and Aeschraes were led to a tournament ground after a month of trial, and informed the victor would be a Master, the other would earn nothing but disgrace. They would only have victory when one was dead.\n\n     The duel was apocalyptic. Axiaothea and Aeschraes pit themselves against the other as Peltra and the council watched. Contemporaneous accounts mention that at first, there had been seats and areas for observation for the students and faculty, but within ten minutes, all sheltered in holdfasts across the Academy as the destruction they wreathed across the site nearly killed them all.\n\n     It lasted six hours. This was unheard of, possibly the longest duel committed outside of folk-lore and religious fables. By magic’s nature, most Magi consider great and powerful strikes superior in duels, as to get the most out of their body’s power before it drains and because none before had anywhere near this much power stored within them. Not only that, but the strikes themselves were exceptionally powerful, and the Mayikprolollan’s council would speak that they had not yet believed a Magi could use such power for so long.\n\n     By the end, both Axiaothea and Aeschraes were near to bleeding to death upon the stones. The entire tournament ground was a blasted ruin, and the area was so laden with magic that the council declared it too dangerous to tread on for decades after. Peltra and the council were both forced to withdraw several hundred yards and erect barriers of both stone and magic to protect themselves. Both students were so covered in lacerations; acid, heat, and cold burns; and had drained and spilled so much blood from the other that gore completely hid their skin and steam and magic openly radiated from their bodies that their bodies actively burned and scarred from the magic-sickness.\n\n     The end of the event is the only one actually recorded in complete detail as the council had both been busy hiding for the main battle and had been so desperately afraid of their decision’s future repercussions that they detailed and notarized the entire event with hopes to stave off vengeance with legal backing.\n\n     Aeschraes fell to his knees, verging on death. He and Axiaothea exchanged several words, too far from earshot to be recorded, and both laughed, cried, and then both at once. The council and Peltra both seemed nervous at this sudden sign of solidarity, and the council’s obsessive writings noted that: \n\n     “The two had kindly smiles for one another that were coated in blood, but observers as astute as the Council of the Mayikprolollan could see that these were devil smiles. They seemed to have wolf teeth, and their twisted visages of evil and destruction made their demonic blood clear and that Aversaria should never fault the council for failing to control such unearthly beings.”\n\n     As Aeschraes seemed about to pass out, Peltra encouraged Axiaothea to finish him. After Axiaothea responded with anger at this, Peltra shouted at Axiaothea from across the tournament grounds.\n\n     “Remember, girl, you’ll spend the rest of your sorry life in some other lecher’s bed if you do not kill him!” is the most accepted account of what she said.\n\n     Unverifiable tales would say Axiaothea gave Aeschraes a sad look, who nodded at her in acceptance, and then she instead attacked a surprised Peltra. The Magister, despite her fame and power, only just barely blocked the spell thanks to Axiaothea’s collapsing health. Peltra managed a single shot in retaliation, piercing Axiaothea’s stomach with a summoned blade, but a second strike caused Axiaothea’s tutor to be charged with so much electrical force that Peltra’s blood instantly turned to vapor and her body exploded violently. \n\n     The Aironoian is then said to have readied an insanely powerful spell that swept the field with fire. The flames danced around Aeschraes, not harming him, and also within only inches of the cowering council. The council record (edited multiple times over the next decades in secret, though the public largely knew each edit as they made them due to constant council infighting leading to revelation) reads:\n\n     “The foul Axiaothea, so murderous in her famous blood-rage that had consumed so many innocents over so many years, prepared a fiery spell no doubt prepared from the rituals of an ancient and evil non-human civilization. We of the Council of the Mayikprolollan bravely told her this: ‘We will not bow! We will not prostrate to so foul a one as you!’\n\n     “Foul Axiaothea then ignited Arch-Magi [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_olitaxanos_var').Char.GetFirstName] and sent him over the side of the mountain, to which the Council of the Mayikprolollan bravely then said: ‘We will do as you say! For we wish no further bloodshed to fall upon the innocent!’ for we of the Council of the Mayikprolollan had cleverly deduced we could trick the she-beast into leaving the Academy and its many valued acolytes were we to pretend to follow her wishes.”\n\n     Despite the lack of agreement most have with the Mayikprolollan’s account of the events, most scholars agree the council pleaded for mercy as she threatened to kill them all. Axiaothea demanded the council immediately rewrite the rules, the paper and quill still in front of them from frantic editing just before the duel, so that nobody would have to die. Last man standing would be the Magi, but a death would be solely the council’s responsibility, and not the pupils. The council agreed to her demands, and her blood-loss and excessive magical use finally caught up, and she collapsed. Aeschraes turned to look at her, blinked as the council cowered and cried, and then too collapsed.\n\n     By the rules of the competition, Aeschraes had won. Most spoke in these early years after that Axiaothea was the true winner, and that Aeschraes had only won because of technicality. Not only did he only last seconds more, but Axiaothea had also proven herself by destroying her teacher and clearly having been able to wipe out the council while Aeschraes struggled to even remain conscious. \n\n     They gave Aeschraes the rank of Magi of the Mayikprolollan. Axiaothea gained prestige but had earned no legal backing from the Mayikprolollan, and they considered her curriculum over. The Council hastily sent her back to her family before she could awake and likely kill everyone in the academy, and Aeschraes recovered in a place of honor with the school and then left immediately after for the legions. He would soon join State Legio XXI ‘Anesimasios’. While a State Legion, the most elite and centrally controlled armies of Aversaria, Aeschraes’s family, maintained deep connections with them. They were an Etepezean legion, the Governorate that his family more often than not ruled, and his dynasty had been a long patron and sponsor of the Legion they oft led.\n\n     They were also the most prestigious Legion in Aversaria, often nicknamed ‘the Aautokratir’s Own’ and Aversaria had honored them by allowing their name to be that of the reigning Aautokratir. Not only was he connected, but he was also extremely powerful, and after a public display and furious politicking from both Aeschraes and his family, he was Legon within a year. Even as Legon of the most respected Legion in Aversaria, he still faced great disrespect from those he met. His duel in the Mayikprolollan was famous, but tales seemed not to care about his substantial power, but of Axiaothea being ‘cheated’ from victory.\n\n     His own men even named Aeschraes ‘the Second’ behind his back. Even though he was clearly the most powerful Magi in his family, he was also the murderer of his own father and many others, and had somehow left a duel in which he proved himself more powerful than possibly any Magi in history with a worse reputation than he had entered. Politically, he was nowhere closer to gaining power and breaking free of the constraints of his family, and his prestige had somehow diminished.\n\n     On the other side of Aversaria, Axiaothea’s family took back their scion and quickly deemed necessary to remove her from their care. Luck came to her father, Governor Metricon, when Aautokratir [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_anesimasios_var').Char.GetFirstName] finally announced his intentions to marry. Anesimasios had been striving to end the east-west political divide of Aversaria and had lived as a bachelor in order to keep the nobles pacified, most scheming to marry into his dynasty instead of planning assassination or revolt. He had apparently decided he had established his rule enough to stave off the nobility, and sought the union of a powerful eastern family to merge the divide. Metricon knew just the bride to do so.\n\n     Grand ceremony followed, Axiaothea still being far too wounded to break out of the new cage they had put her within. Many claimed this was a new hope for Aversaria, for the glorious reunion of east and west during which all would finally come back together as kin, over which Anesimasios and Metricon would forge a golden age of Imperial renewal.\n\n     Aversaria followed Anesimasios’s wedding ceremony with almost an entire year of celebration and festivities for the peasantry and nobility both. He was increasingly being called the Aautokratir who would save Aversaria, many peasants naming him the '[GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_anesimasios_var').Char.GetNickname]' for his great generosity. Not only were the peasantry enjoying the first moments of optimism they’d possessed for generations, the nobility too celebrated. The wedding was the first genuine chance at bridging the east-west divide, the first chance to turn their eyes from the hundred petty wars between the nobility and the governorates, and an opportunity for profits for all.\n\n     Most seemed in agreement that Anesimasios and Axiaothea would be the ones to herald the golden age Aversaria had desperately prayed for. Not only did the Aautokratir promise to end the ancient divides, but he had even begun an impressive series of reforms with the exceptionally rare backing of the nobility.\n\n     He’d reign in the Mayikprolollan’s powers and establish control of how they tutor their students (likely from Axiaothea’s prodding); he would revise the now-ancient laws pertaining to slavery and citizenship that had remained untouched since the Agionist Rebellions; He would give the Conclave that managed the many faiths of the Aautokrata more power and allowed to reign in the increasingly schismatic faiths; an impressive infrastructure and building campaign would return Opakhasia to some sense of prosperity; he would establish of ‘fortress-cities’ inspired by the Iyrossi Communes on his familial lands in Katraddia and eventually spread to the rest of the governorate to centralize the power there and end its many petty warlord-aautokratirs; and he would begin a massive series of tax reform to allow the governor’s collecting of tax from their nobles for the first time in centuries and take several massive loans from the [Concept('gisreddean_banking_system','banks of the Gisreddes')|E] to help fund this.\n\n     Axiaothea, despite her obvious distaste for her position as a simple wife, by all reports took to the role. While openly incendiary with her husband, she strived to support his plans and goals, and court records say that Anesimasios valued her for her shrewd intellect and political mind. Several court officials even noted that Axiaothea had appeared to warm to her husband, and had grown close with him in time.\n\n     Aeschraes’s own fortunes were mixed. While he struggled to find any respect in his Legion, Anesimasios valued the connection with his dynasty to help control the nobility of Etepezea and often called upon Aeschraes to consult upon matters of magic or warfare. Despite this, however, Aeschraes would often complain of many slights, both minor and major. This was because of his continued position as junior in his family, his brothers often being consulted in matters without Aeschraes’s notice. There were also many rumblings, especially in the decades after, that Aeschraes’s many slights were in fact caused by the prodding of Axiaothea, who still wished to see her former rival falter.\n\n     The most known of these, and the only one speculators could firmly mark against Axiaothea, is the denial of Aeschraes’s request to be declared Arch-Legon of four damaged legions in Katraddia in order to put down Katraddian warlord [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_demthox_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed]. Anesamios is reported to have been open to the proposal, but Axiaothea stated it would be incendiary to the Katraddian nobility to grant their legions to an Etepezean, and that it would destabilize the delicate balance of power among the legions. Whether this was a simple political move or a simple cover to slight Aeschraes is unknown.\n\n     Despite the conflict, contemporaries recorded Aeschraes and Axiaothea as having sent several letters to one another in this brief interim and to have spoken occasionally during official business, though all the letters were later intentionally or unintentionally lost in Legio XXI’s Coup of Oraispol. Their relationship is unclear, but there seems to be little sign that their rivalry, if it had continued, was anywhere near as incendiary as it had become in the Mayikprolollan. All reports at the time seemed to agree the two had, if not become friends once more, settled into some form of mutual respect.\n\n     Aversaria seemed ready to flourish, Axiaothea and Aeschraes both seeming to represent a new era of the joining of east and west.\n\n     To not only have bridged the divide and earned love from the nobility and peasantry both, but also propose the most radical reform campaign of any Aautokratir in centuries with their full support, marked Anesimasios as possibly the greatest Aversarian statesman in generations. Or perhaps things were not as optimistic as they appeared. Perhaps while the nobility celebrated his reforms, they resented them in private. Or perhaps the forces that he did anger, those he felt his supporters outweighed, were too powerful after all. Or perhaps he had put too much trust in those around him, and those who he valued as lieutenants.\n\n     During one of the many feasts in honor of the marriage, several months after its official consecration, guests said Anesamios was in a rare troubled mood. The aautokratir, normally quite gregarious with his guests and always setting time aside to speak privately with each of his guests in order to ensure their approval and also search for any hint of betrayal, was far more reserved than usual. He sat upon his throne and grimly stared at the feast, attempts to cheer him through festival shows or by words from close friends failing. Even Axiaothea, who he normally attempted to lavish with praise and gifts publicly, faced rebuttal when attempting to speak with him. This confounded the nobility, and many prepared counter-spells in private just in case this was the foretelling of the increasingly common court purges his predecessors had become known for.\n\n     Legon Aeschraes was also in attendance with members of Legio XXI as guests of honor after putting down the Katraddian warlord Demthox ‘the Heart Eater’. One of the most noted happenings of the feast was several running conversations between him in Axiaothea, often done in private or far enough for other guests not to overhear, with rituals prepared to ensure none listened in on their conversation.\n\n     The words between the two are of course unknown, and reports of what they appeared to have said are incredibly contradictory and likely apocryphal. Depending on the tale, the two had a tearful reunion in conversation and rediscovered their (alleged) lost love, secretly plotted to murder Anesimasios together, argued with one another after one of them announced they would kill the Aautokratir, swore an eternal rivalry with the other, or any combination of these or a thousand other suggestions.\n\n     What contemporaries reported with surety, however, is the feast’s ending. Anesimasios appeared even more troubled after watching one of Axiaothea and Aeschraes’s discussions; and even more so after a servant handed him a missive informing Anesimasios of the destruction of Aironoian Noble Legions XXI ‘Heartrenders’, XLIV ‘The Kartharaddi’s Fear’, LXIV ‘Gravitas’, and XCII ‘Swords of Tharenion’ in the ongoing [three_cities_war|E].\n\n     Anesimasios stood suddenly and announced that he would have a toast of bloodwine to Legon Aeschraes, declaring him in a rather surprising turn to be the ‘greatest of his friends and allies’ and ‘the most honorable of the legons of Aversaria’, before announcing that it would take the might of his storied State Legion to end the eastern rebellion. Aeschraes appeared both surprised at the sudden praise and incredibly troubled, showing a rare amount of nervousness from his normal imperious demeanor as he stuttered out his thanks and promises to control the rebellious eastern merchant leagues.\n\n     Axiaothea then handed Aautokratir Anesimasios a glass of his bloodwine, which Anesimasios drank far faster and slovenly than was normal for him or appropriate for his station. He took several steps down from his dais, smiled at Axiaothea and shook the hand of the late-arriving Kothexia Othrycia of Nadost, and then died. Blood suddenly spilled from his mouth and onto the closest feast table, and Anesimasios struggled to stand for a moment, desperately attempted to perform an unknown spell, and then collapsed. The panic was immediate.\n\n     Oraispol immediately fell into great chaos as Anesimasios’s guard and the visiting Legionnaires from the XXI rushed to protect the fallen Aautokratir and attempt to revive him. Magi and surgeons were rushed to the aautokratir while the nobility panicked and quickly began retreating from the city as the stench of civil war suddenly fell upon Aversaria anew.\n\n     Often noted between descriptions of the chaos are Axiaothea and Aeschraes. Axiaothea was apparently distraught at the event, rushing to her husband’s side and demanding he get up to no avail, though many claimed this as a simple cover. It is also noted that she stood up after realizing her husband was dead and had not shed a single tear, did not appear any sadder than she had before the event, and possessed a demeanor both ‘grim and horrifying’. Her supporters would later point out that Axiaothea showing any emotion other than annoyance or anger was already an aberration, detractors claim it as evidence for her initial reaction being false.\n\n     Aeschraes had been one of the first to the Aautokratir’s side, and was also the first to announce someone had poisoned him after discovering the chalice at his feet. He would take command of the aautokratir’s guard in the immediate aftermath and direct them to stop further visitors from leaving the city, and then gave the chalice to several of his men to safeguard for later investigation. They would lose the chalice within the day, however, and many claim that Aeschraes had in fact poisoned the aautokratir and had his men destroy the evidence.\n\n     Before Aeschraes relinquished control to the local legion and fled the city, soldiers noted him and Axiaothea having a last conversation. There are likewise greatly contradictory tellings of this event, most tales either saying that the two celebrated an assassination well performed, immediately accused the other of killing Anesimasios, shared a final loving kiss or a final platonic embrace, or simply asked the other what had just happened. These words are the more speculated of the conversations the two had the night, as this conversation was the last time anyone would know of the two speaking in person.\n\n     Whether they had reaffirmed or killed their friendship, however, Legon Aeschraes and his men fled Oraispol. Speculation was immediate and frantic. Aversaria had assassinated over fifteen aautokratirs (often within days of coronation and by their immediate successor) in the last century, but most considered them poor and controversial rulers and many had possessed both clear means and motive or even openly claimed to having done so in the immediate aftermath. Anesimasios, however, was universally well-loved and without major rivals. Not only this, but his high amount of support meant that none had expected any to be brave enough to kill them, and his cooperation with the east and local support in the west meant that the most likely and major factions to assassinate an aautokratir in Aversaria had been firmly on his side.\n\n     While many pointed out that Anesimasios never actually performed any of his desired reforms, and that the only proof of his competence was the (impressive regardless) reigning in the nobility and east and west factions, the people of Aversaria mourned. Perhaps this was only because they had not given him the chance to fail them, but the people rapidly declared Anesimasios a martyr, and tearful crowds gave solemn prayers across the realm. Whether his reforms would have been successful or another miserable failure, his untimely death immediately cemented him as a hero, and meant that accusing one’s rival of the murder had become an incredibly common and powerful political tool.\n\n     The only ones who did not accuse another seemed to be the small faction arguing that the aautokratir’s death had been a suicide. He had been preparing reform for a decade and desperately dragging his way past the nobility, had been a bachelor most of his life with only a minimal interest in women or sex, and his dreadful mood in his final hours were (in their estimation) a clear sign of depression, and his gluttonous chugging of his poison an obvious example of his eagerness to die. This argument has remained controversial for nearly a century since.\n\n     Detractors accused Legon Aeschraes, many claiming that he had assassinated Anesimasios because of slights against his prestige and so that he could attain higher power through taking the throne, the losing of the chalice especially damning. Aeschraes would often point out that Anesimasios had just given him an extremely prestigious compliment that politically would have placed him at the level of or higher than his brothers, as well as an especially lucrative chance to gain glory by securing Aironoi that would have won him the support of eastern nobles that he would have needed if he truly wanted to take power. Not to mention that having his own men lose the chalice would have been far too obvious for a royal assassin to do. His detractors would regularly point out his own nervousness at the declarations, and that he would have ordered the assassination before he learnt of his new standing.\n\n     Governor Metricon of Aironoi faced his own level of accusations. Anesimasios may have wanted to join east and west with Metricon’s blessing, but the merger also proved an explicit threat to Aironoi’s increasing position as the dominate Governorate of Aversaria. Were Aironoi to reconcile with Etepezea, Aironoi’s trajectory would by necessity freeze, and Metricon would lose his dynasty’s chance to secure rule of the true center of prosperity and power in Aversaria. Others pointed out that his own daughter was in a prime place to kill the aautokratir, that he had mysteriously not traveled to Anesimasios’s festival feasts, and that his marrying of Axiaothea placed one of his own children in an easy position to usurp power. Metricon would later blame his own daughter, and use this to deflect much blame, though his honesty in the accusations was uncertain.\n\n     Many suspected the Mayikprolollan, the council angered by Anesimasios’s desire to reform the institution and either afeared of Axiaothea’s growing power in the court or finally hoping to place her or Aeschraes upon the throne as puppets. The Council of the Mayikprolollan would give a flurry of reasons they did not deserve suspicion, including the fact that they had clearly not managed control of their former pupils, and that the ensuing political chaos failed to bring them any form of substantial gains. They would rapidly rise in suspicion after several members of the council publicly declared that Arch-Magi [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_iornos_var').Char.GetFirstName] had ordered the assassination and was thus to be executed. This suspicion would immediately disappear, however, when the following series of inept political chaos that consumed the council would see thirty Arch-Magi purged and over eighty council members and instructors accused of ordering the assassination whenever politically expedient.\n\n     Governor Bozycsarxa of Katraddia faced accusations, as well as several Katraddian nobles. Many suspected Anesimasios of planning far more radical reforms in the north than he publically claimed and assured the northerners of. Namely, the court widely speculated that Anesimasios had finally planned to divide Katraddia into smaller governorates to ease its administration, declare its governorial legions controlled by a co-governor of Imperial choice, shrinking and reinforcing portions of the indefensible border with the northeast, expand Malcois even further across the Eramasic River, and deploy multiple State Legions to enforce Imperial control until the governorate stabilized and the many local warlords were subdued or dead. Bozycsarxa was quick to point out that Anesimasios was her own cousin and half-Katraddian himself, that she had enjoyed a fantastic relationship with the aautokratir and secured many boons for her governorate, and that the ensuing chaos of his assassination somehow led to the situation in the north worsening even further than it had before.\n\n     Blame and accusation fell upon many others. [GetTitleByKey('k_orydian_dynastic_league').GetNameNoTier|l] had been in a series of scandals over the finances of their merchant companies, and Anesimasios had threatened to assume royal control of their assets if they failed to purge themselves of traitors to the throne. Magi and self proclaimed ‘[GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_delendea_bha_var').Char.GetNickname]’ [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_delendea_bha_var').Char.GetFirstName] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_delendea_bha_var').Char.GetDynastyName], leader of the Three Cities Rebellion, had long claimed she would one day kill Anesimasios herself were he not to follow her increasingly erratic demands. Many (allegedly) Aversarian warlords in Katraddia would claim to have done the assassination for prestige or accuse their rivals of dishonorably ordering the killing, and the Aversarian nobility of course rapidly pointed fingers at every single political rival who could conceivably have done the act.\n\n     To list all the minor accusations made against increasingly doubtful culprits would be impossible. Four [Concept('chevalie', 'Marcher')|E] [antimagic_orders|E] proudly declared to have done the act, only to be censored by the Conclave of Raocourt who condemned the death (Anesimasios had long attempted to improve northern relations) and then immediately faced accusations by multiple Kalthipsomian nobles and the high king of Chevalie. Several Aversarians then accused the high king, before the suspect of the day became Kalathipsomian bandit leader Zicys ‘the Lover of Widows’. After Zicys crafted an exceptionally detailed and well-written letter over his alibi (raiding the village of Thurione for sport) suspects were made of Sjalvolki and Kardwen chiefs, seven Kashiryan Magi sects, Öltenic warlord Drudgidic ‘the Many Masked’, traveling Marcher spy Led Vigaron, several [Concept('lichdom', 'Liches')|E] of the Lichdoms (several of which even sent proclamations south that they had done so which were completely ignored). The Colonial Authority in Sarradon would even attempt to accuse multiple [Concept('wardenism','Wardenite')|E] rulers, begging for reinforcements from the homeland to ‘avenge’ the aautokratir.\n\n     Assassinations were not uncommon in Aversaria, but the assassination of Anesimasios had no single figure with clear means, motive or opportunity. It would prove perhaps the most high-profile and storied assassination in Aversarian history. To make it worse, with the chalice lost and political machinations and chaos causing no autopsy of Anesimasios’s body before his funeral pyre (likely at the pressuring of nobles who benefited from the confusion), it was not even sure if poison had been the culprit. Many claimed that Anesimasios’s attempted spell was a counter-spell against an attack, or that the murderer had poisoned him earlier, or that he had been dying of a cancer.\n\n     More than any other, however, accusations settled on Axiaothea. Many declared that her history of murdering those who controlled her leash and her clear ‘blood-madness’ meant she was likely to brutalize any man within arm’s distance of her. Every public disagreement she had with Anesimasios went from a clear sign she was his respected equal to an obvious example of how she had publicly plotted and desired to kill her husband. Likewise, Axiaothea had never been private about desiring power and freedom, and which better way to attain these things than to become the absolute ruler of the world’s greatest empire? Even if she did not wish this herself, she had possibly killed Anesimasios at the orders of her father, or at the orders of other nobles, or by puppet-masters in the Mayikprolollan. And most damning of all, she was the one who had handed Anesimasios the chalice which most believed poisoned him.\n\n     She, of course, protested this. She claimed to have found Anesimasios a good man and pointed out time and time again that killing her husband so soon into his reign and when she remained so controversial would have been the most idiotic of plays. She had gained far more than enough power and freedom as his wife, especially as, by all reports, Anesimasios had no interest in pressuring her to join his marriage bed or possibly even in the fairer sex altogether. She had extreme amounts of autonomy to do as she wished, and could satisfy her desire for political power through her valued counsel to her husband. Others believed she had done the act with Aeschraes, out of a desire to take power with him or to marry over Anesimasios’s corpse, their secretive conversations considered highly suspect.\n\n     Whether they had found forgiveness or become true rivals during these meetings, however, Aeschraes saw his chance to achieve the power he desired. He only needed an excuse. The two appeared to have little interest in directly mentioning the other thereafter, but already their camps increasingly pointed the finger at the other. Lines were being drawn rapidly, the two groups consuming all others. The easterners claimed Aeschraes had ordered the assassination and wished to blame Axiaothea to degrade Aironoi, and the westerners claimed the opposite.\n\n     In the following Blood Senate, Axiaothea placed herself into the listings despite objections from her family, who had sent her sister and childhood companion, Methenia. Methenia was her father’s chosen heir-apparent, as he wished for his much more agreeable and politically trained daughter to take control of the realm. Not only this, but he also publically claimed that his daughter had performed the assassination and betrayed the family, and wished for her removal from the dynasty.\n\n     There were over two hundred in the following listings, even after the standard brutal politicking had ended with most applicants being killed or pressured to withdraw. Nearly every major noble family in Aversaria was in attendance, for all knew that the Empire sat on the verge of civil war, and knew that whoever controlled the throne would hold the advantage.\n\n     Axiaothea entered the tournament grounds and faced her sister as all watched, even her father. To lose would be to return to her family’s control at her most fortunate, to win would finally give her control.\n\n     The blast of magic that Axiaothea unleashed killed every single living being besides herself within leagues of the Blood Senate’s grounds. She had blasted the ground to ash, and she stood seven steps deep into the ground for the great crater she had formed. Observers from as far as the Imperial Isle reported the beam of light burning out of the horizon and bringing clouds to swirl.\n\n     In a moment, she had assassinated the heads of nearly every major dynasty, as well as their chosen strongest Magi, and hundreds of other members of the court and local citizenry. Aversaria reeled in shock, and the succession became even more unclear. Aaxiaothea had won the Blood Senate in a way that cemented herself as the strongest Aversarian Magi in history. She had also done it in the most politically devastating manner, and Aversaria nearly fell to civil war just over the matter of whether her power as a Magi outweighed the need for vengeance.\n\n     Aeschraes jumped at this. As she traveled home from the Blood Senate, his Legion rushed towards Oraispol and performed a coup of the city, purging it of Axiaothea loyalists and forcing her to flee east. He wrote the great Declaration of Blood-Right, which was circulated across Aversaria immediately. In it, he decried Axiaothea as a pretender and the murderer of Anesimasios, and the results of the Blood Senate to be illegal. Axiaothea traveled east to her family lands, the succession of Aironoi in chaos with Metricon and Methenia both dead and no aautokratir to declare a new governor. Axiaothea entered Asiupoli and used her (disputed) authority to take control of the Governorate and declared herself the rightful Aautokratia. In the west, Aeschraes did the same."

 THE_CIVIL_WAR_AND_FRODBROKNA_TEXT_4:0 "     Opakhasia burned and faced such brutal devastation that the southeast became a blasted wasteland of latent magical energies in which nobody besides disparate scavenger-clans could survive. Malcois faced its greatest slave revolt in history, the Iyrossi finally rebelling after a thousand years of slavery and the rest of the Malcoisiac slave caste joining them after both of the warring sides of the Governorate destroyed one another. Kalathipsomi burned from an endless series of competing warlords and shifting loyalties within the Governorate. Axiaothea betrayed the ancient truces with the Öltenic and brought order in the east into collapse. Etepezea crumbled from the intrigues of its own court as an endless array of nobility seemed to believe now their chance to cast down Aeschraes’s ancient dynasty.\n\n     Katraddia perhaps took worse than any other, especially by its end. Not only did their mercenary Hēprasitosiac Legions pledge themselves to whichever warlord paid them the most, and not only did their many self-styled Aautokratirs tear the region apart or attempt great invasions of Aironoi, but they faced endless incursions from the neighboring heathens. A thousand tribes, a thousand cultures and faiths, all sat just within or outside of Katraddia’s borders. Partic, Huegodoc, Mondecny. But the Aversarians feared one group more than any other. They were the Sjalvolki, an ancient tribal people ignorant of their descent from those few surviving humans who slew Aersanon and who worshipped a faith unknowingly centered on the Godherja. They were warlike yet honor bound, their faith lending them an obsession with ritual hunting of great monsters and a culture that viewed Magi as honored members of their local villages who should always remain at their edge and away from honest company.\n\n     Sjalvolki culture was split between north and south, the northerners being known for honor and conservatism, loyal to the tribal ways of their forefathers and rejecting Magi more than any of their kin. The southerners were more cosmopolitan, having long settled along the great rivers instead of living in the mountains and forests like the northerners, and had developed significant works of poetry and saw the value in maintaining relations with other cultures. Both were not so distinct for foreigners to know the difference, for all of them were proud warriors and savage foes who regularly raided into Aversaria and did battle with the Magi for glory and for their riches. Even before the Aversarians had come, they had long battled with the now-ancient [Concept('kartharadd', 'Kartharaddi')|E], and never in their history had either empires been able to subjugate them or any Sjalvolki unite them.\n\n     In great numbers they traveled southwest and ranged deep into Katraddia. They smashed those State, Noble and Mercenary Legions that attempted to stop them, and dozens of other cultures from within and outside Katraddia followed them in with great raids of the Imperials or with dreams of retaking their lost homelands.\n\n     As the war dragged on, Aversaria would see hundreds of legendary heroes and villains.

Aeschraes was no longer called ‘Second’ but more commonly as the ‘Blood Aautokratir’, so named for his exacting brutality and his iron-grip rule over the [GetTitleByKey('e_oraispol_aautokrata').GetNameNoTier|l]. Others would name Axiaothea the ‘Magi of Blades’, so named for her impressive martial ability, which she used on the front-lines just as often as she used magic. She would claim many enemies, such as [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_alphioxis_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] at the Battle of the Stellarnar Fields or Legon [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_darkblood_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] in a magical duel in the citadel of Axarathad.\n\n     Aeschraes himself had slain many, Legon [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_mechondagr_var').Char.GetFirstName] through an ordered execution, [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_amon_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] with poison, and the Orydrian Dynastic League with a four-month long ritual that turned every single one of their cities and members to ash after spies informed him they had sold a shipment of weapons to an Axiaothea-aligned mercenary company. This spell took months of preparation however, and would have been impossible had the Orydrian’s had stronger Magi or knew how Aeschraes intended to punish them. A powerful symbol of Aeschraes’s power, but nowhere near enough to destroy Axiaothea."

 THE_CIVIL_WAR_AND_FRODBROKNA_TEXT_5:0 "     Both had become desperate. They saw their rightful realm crumbling around them, and the increasing fragility of their claims to rule. The more they destroyed the realm against one another, the more the realm seemed to turn on them for causing its destruction. It seemed to be a race for not who would take Aversaria, but who would end up killing it in doing so.\n\n     They each sent explorers across every ancient library and tomb in Aversaria and to every library and place of power around the known world. Paid researchers from the Aversarian Cartographer’s Union, hired foreign mercenary groups, or small and elite units in enemy territory searching for the oldest of lore. They used every weapon and ritual they found against one another with devastating effect, and Aversaria in her entirety went from one of the richest and most prospering regions of the world to an unpopulated wasteland wracked by constant famine and disease. Magic had turned once great cities to ash and some of the world’s most prosperous farmland was now forever uninhabitable. The largest economy in [the_continent|E|l] and its most powerful Empire was now a blighted land empty of citizenry. More than half of the population had died before it finally ended.\n\n     Both Axiaothea and Aeschraes learned of Self-Replicating Blood Magic during their schooling and dreamed of finding the ancient spell to destroy the other. The Sarradonians had nearly wiped out their entire continent with it, and they had possessed half of Aversaria’s magical power. Both reasoned their personal Magi Cabals and their own power combined would be what the ritual needed to be controlled. The Sarradonians had lacked power and had not understood what they played with. The Aversarians could control and refine it, target it at their enemies, wipe out all who fought them in an instant with no chance of the spell being blocked, and could easily end it whenever they wished. Once their foe was dead, they could hold the ritual above the heads of the world, securing their rule forever. Their personal hunters scoured Sarradon as they searched for any sign of the long-erased ritual.\n\n     It is unknown if they finally found it or if they had both found enough of the ritual and had become so desperate that they attempted to guess or deduce the rest. Both found Self-Replicating Blood Magic near simultaneously, and both prepared to use it while they knew the risks it brought to all of Aversaria. They both raced to complete the ritual first, and the victor was Aeschraes.\n\n     Aeschraes had since formed a new family, a political marriage with a vassal dynasty granting him several children. His oldest was still a young girl in 1200 IS, named Arias after his lost sister and possibly the only person he still remembered fondly. He had around him a cabal of the hundred most powerful Magi of his era (those not among Axiaothea’s hundred finest, at least), and legions of slaves and soldiers both.\n\n     He gave them all to perform the ritual.\n\n     Romanticization would later say that Aeschraes lost his last chance of redemption when he sacrificed [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_arias_var').Char.GetFirstName] to perform his ritual, along with the rest of his children, his wife, and hundreds of slaves and less important Magi. He and two dozen of his greatest Magi began the ritual and aimed Self-Replicating Blood Magic directly at the east, hoping to kill Axiaothea in Asiupoli and annihilate a dozen other major lords and rebel cities.\n\n     That night in 1200 IS would be the beginning of the world’s true end. It would bring forth [frodbrokna|E]."

As every major rival turned to ash and Aversaria saw the consequence of resistance, [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_aeschraes_var').Char.GetFirstName] and his [magi|E] ended the spell.\n\n     Only to realize they couldn’t.\n\n     They managed to only briefly pause its spread outside of the first cities when the first Magi in their ritual chambers detonated into fire. The sources are unclear if the first to die had been Magi [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_void_walker_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] or the [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_blighted_witch_var').Char.GetNickname], but suddenly Aeschraes’s cabal struggled to maintain the spell as the weight on their shoulders increased. Either Nycenea or the ‘Blighted Witch’ then similarly ignited, and then [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_iron_walker_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] melted to death from the effects of Exposure-Sickness, and then ignited another, and another burst into ash, and so forth as it got harder and harder to hold the spell and protect themselves from their discharging comrades.\n\n     As each of them died, Aversaria felt the effects. Self-Replicating Blood Magic quickly went out of control across Aironoi, and then spread across Opakhasia and Malcois, through Katraddia and into [kashirya|E]. It burst through Oraispol and in the Black Mountains, and [Concept('chevalie', 'Marchers')|E] reported seeing the lights of burning [Concept('lichdom', 'Liches')|E] from their northernmost towers. Even lands as far and exotic as Adabyss and Kathun-Kai fell into chaos as the spell ravaged their lands.\n\n     Over half of all remaining Aversarians died along with the rest of Aeschraes’s cabal, and more than a quarter of the rest of the world population would perish with them. Self-Replicating Blood Magic caused so much suffering and despair and unleashed so much [magic|E|l] into the world that, along with the decades leading up to the end, caused [aersanon|E] to stir in their sleep. A single ethereal eye upon the dead god’s body cracked open, Their infinite gaze looking outward in death.\n\n     The survivors would name this event [frodbrokna|E].\n\n     Across the northern wayline, a giant rift into the center of the world split and cracked open, so large as to swallow entire nations as Aeras crumbled into it. In the sky above, [aervalr|E] cracked and then shattered. A great ray of sickly green light connected the two as the great shards of Aervalr seemed to drift slowly into the Rift. Magic around the world went hay-wire as once again reality shifted, and millions more died.\n\n     Out of the Rift came the fabric of reality itself. Just as the death of Aersanon had shaken the world, so too did Their stirring. Aersanon’s mind cracked and opened, and from this great hole in reality the world from within that mind spilled into the material. Every deathly thought and memory of Aersanons, every single soul who had ever passed, every single memory, dream and nightmare, all of them spilled across the world. It was the merging of the realm only gleamed and forged in the deepest slumbers of the living and the mundane. The realization of a world once only seen by the most maddened Magi and at the moment’s between a Lich’s death and undeath.\n\n     The location of this great void was the far northeast, somewhere east of the [Concept('mayikrata', 'Mayikprolollan')|E] and at the edge of Katraddia. From it came nightmares, an ephemeral [Concept('the_fog', 'Fog')|E] that spilled out across the great forests of Katraddia and seemed to move with a mind of its own. Sometimes it would rest at the edge of rivers or gather around mountains, and other times it would rush forward or climb uphill. Within, human terror now lived. A human in the Fog stands within the realm of the ethereal, and within, it made their nightmares manifest. These are not simple thoughts, it is not the first thing that comes to one’s mind when they think of what they fear. These are the deepest and most primordial forms of dread, the horrible combinations of every single thing those unfortunate enough to face Fog dream of in their darkest sleep."

In another, strange structures not alike any geography possible in reality twist upwards in endless black spirals that seem to reach into the sun.\n\n     The Fog consumed the entire Governorate of Katraddia, Axiaothea and every major ruler in Aironoi was dead, and Aeschraes’s realm collapsed into anarchy. Aversaria had finally destroyed itself, and the world with it.\n\n     The Fog moved forward without stopping, randomly halting for a year or two and rushing hundreds of leagues forward as it wished. It consumed cities and kingdoms, entire cultures withering away or finding their numbers too low to continue after the devastation. Tales even say the global catastrophes and the Fog reached as far as Kathun-Kai, the many merchants suddenly vanishing and eastern trade dying. The last word sent west was of the legendary capital city of [loen_chaeon|E], long called the greatest city in the world by Aversarian scholars, slowly being consumed by dark monsters brought upon by Frodbrokna.

What remained of Katraddia itself gave little resistance, the already disunited Imperials crumbling before them. The only resistance came from Governor [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_ioldon_var').Char.GetFirstName], who had long been battling over a dozen pretenders and warlords during the Civil War and who inherited his title from his father, who died from Self-Replicating Blood Magic.\n\n     Alongside him had died Ioldon’s six brothers, four sisters, and eight grandchildren, as well as his entire extended family, all dying from the Civil War, Self-Replicating Blood Magic, Frodbrokna or the Fog. He would unite the last remnants of Katraddia’s legions, its people, and their allies. His own wife was Sjalvolki, a political marriage to make peace with a raiding clan, and many Sjalvolki and other tribal peoples joined the Imperials instead of escaping alone.\n\n     What followed would become a hectic running battle south over the next decades. The tribals of the north poured south in chaotic hordes, attempting to find safety on the coast and constantly running into Imperials attempting the same. Both sides almost endlessly battled while also trying to escape and block the other off. While Ioldon gathered the survivors, the Sjalvolki too organized.\n\n     One would rise above all. He was the greatest warrior the Sjalvolki had ever known and their most cunning. It surprised many outsiders to find they equally celebrated him for his knowledge of culture and faith and love of spoken poetry. He was the finest statesman who had ever led them, one that spoke twelve languages and knew the value and the power of intrigue when necessary. He was glorious, and he was also compassionate, seemingly always finding proper solutions considered widely just, and sparing his enemies or treating them with dignity and respect as he destroyed them with masterful strategy.\n\n     He was [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_cenware_var').Char.GetFirstName], the man who would build the new era of the world, the one after Aversaria. Only as a teenager his father died within the Fog and his clan began their [dovatkning|E]. They were one of a hundred clans of the Daukeni culture, considered the most in-between the north and south Sjalvolki. As was the tradition of the Sjalvolki clans, each warrior and leader of his tribe came to prove their worth as the successor in a grand battle between all.\n\n     Cenware beat all twenty other contenders, tales saying without killing a single one. They were among the clan’s greatest warriors; old chieftains three times his age with endless experience; young mercenaries returning to the clan from across the world; and even Cenware’s own older brother, [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_eofwine_var').Char.GetFirstName]."

 THE_RISE_OF_THE_NORTH_TEXT_5:0 "     He led his tribe south into Aversaria and then used a mix of warfare and diplomacy to subjugate the other fleeing Sjalvolki tribes. He became the first to lead an army of all Sjalvolki in a single, unified clan. Their leaders bowed to him, and declared him the High King, the only to ever hold this title.\n\n     Cenware not only united the Sjalvolki, however. He called the Tribespact, bringing forth representatives from every Sjalvolki clan and the leaders of vastly different cultures and faiths from across the world. There Cenware made a vow. If they were to aid him and the Sjalvolki in their invasion into Aversaria as a unified force, then all would find equal treatment and could settle their tribes across Aversaria. After shrewd diplomacy and politicking, as well as several shows of power, they agreed. Tribes like the Kardwen, the Goans, and the Partic all agreed to follow Cenware south. The Sjalvolki Imperrech had reformed, not a true empire, but a temporary union of the northern peoples led by Cenware, with an oath to disband it once they had all settled upon the ashes of Aversaria.\n\n     Perhaps the Partic, of all these tribes, were the most notable. Legendary druids from the far north, so far distant that the Sjalvolki had only heard of them from some of the most well-traveled adventurers, they seemed suspiciously ready to join the Imperrech. In fact, they seemed more united in their desire to join than the Sjalvolki clans themselves, their seers taking commands from trees which apparently demanded they join. They would supply Cenware with the largest and most elite force of Magi remaining in the world, on a par with or perhaps stronger than the Aversarians themselves.\n\n     Cenware led the Imperrech against Ioldon and fought a running series of battles with him towards the Grey Passes that connected Katraddia with Kalathipsomi. The entrance into Malcois was too far, and the entrance around the Mayikprollan was cut off early by the Fog. The treacherous Grey Mountains were the only realistic route to find shelter from the Fog on the other side of the Clanmounts, the largest mountain range in the world."

His entire life had been war and death, of watching his homeland consumed by the Fog every day they spent on the trail.\n\n     He and Cenware would battle several more times before the Battle of the Grey Gate, where Cenware routed Nicanoneus and his forces north and forced them to brave the Fog to cross back into Aversaria.

 THE_RISE_OF_THE_NORTH_TEXT_7:0 "     Meanwhile, Cenware crossed the Grey Passes, taking substantial losses but still coming out of the journey far fresher than Nicanoneus’s refugees.\n\n     Kalathipsomi was in chaos. The warlord [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_iron_spike_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_iron_spike_var').Char.GetDynastyName] had tenuously held it together with his connections within Aversaria’s many criminal organizations and assassins guilds and his brutal and oppressive rule at Aeschraes’s blessing. So too had Aeschraes maintained some measure of control in Malcois and Opakhasia with the brutal Legon [karthyn_delenel|E] and his forces, along with Delenel's protege, the sadistic [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_gorassos_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed].\n\n     But during [the_vilnian_assault|E|l], Legan [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_isacea_var').Char.GetFirstName] of State Legio XXI ‘Axiaothea’ declared Aeschraes the greatest threat to Aversaria in history. While many agreed that his destruction of Axiaothea proved him the stronger Magi and technically by law right to rule, his great evils and refusal to state he would not cast Self-Replicating Blood Magic again if he had the resources disturbed the nobility so much that Aversaria stood united against him. Her Legion had once been Aeschraes’s own, Aeschraes having gifted it to his oldest brother after he had began the war, the Legion then going to one of his closest companions upon his brother’s slaying by Axiaothea, who then betrayed him and went over to Axiaothea as he grew disillusioned with Aeschraes’s cause. Isacea had spent her time as Legan being hunted like a dog by Delenel, and her and what allies she could gather began an assault on Oraispol aiming to kill Aeschraes once and for all.\n\n     Aeschraes, now increasingly called the ‘Lord of the Ashes’, survived. His entire inner circle, however, did not. Not only did he lose his top Magi and lieutenants, along with his few remaining Legons and high nobles, but most important fell Iron-Spike and Delenel in one-on-one combat with Isacea. Aeschraes would kill the wounded Isacea after, but his realm finally collapsed into true anarchy, his authority gone with his two lieutenants. When the Sjalvolki entered Kalathipsomi, the civil war following Iron-Spike’s death had already consumed the Governorate, and they easily swept aside what Legions remained.\n\n     First, before joining proper battle with the Imperials, Cenware diverted north. The Mayikprolollan remained in the mountains, its council overthrown by Arch-Magi [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_terrox_var').Char.GetFirstName], a former classmate of Aeschraes and Axiaothea. The Magocracy struggled forward, Frodbrokna having killed so many of its staff that they struggled to control their massive population of slaves. The pass into the Mayikprolollan remained a single great tunnel that brings travelers into the Academy under the mountains, and over a hundred Magi and other soldiers still guarded it against any intruder.\n\n     Cenware, however, did the unthinkable. With magic that had only been told of in tales, his Seers brought Cenware and a small force of his greatest Sjalvolki warriors into the Fog. They called this art Fog Magic, that which slowly takes the sight and brings force madness as it manipulates the mind. Cenware reached the mountains through the Fog and he and his men then scaled them, climbing practically vertically at points as they pioneered Aeras’s largest mountains to break into the ancient fortress.\n\n     He eventually did, and they ambushed the Magi of the Mayikprolollan from above. He was not there to conquer, however. The Mayikprolollan was useless to settle in and removed from his own forces, with little chance to strike him. Instead, he wished for knowledge. He would free the slaves of the Mayikprolollan to bolster his forces, and he and his men would carve a bloody swathe through the Magi as they stole every ancient artifact and piece of knowledge sequestered under the mountain.\n\n     When he left, he had done the impossible. The first man to unite the Sjalvolki, the first to unite the northern peoples, and now the first to sack the Mayikprolollan. In the Sjalvolki tradition, he was more than worthy of wearing a nickname, and his warriors declared him to be Cenware [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_cenware_var').Char.GetNickname]. He returned south, and his Magi, now equipped with the largest stockpile of magical lore in the Continent, invaded Aversaria proper. His brother Eofwine took a force and entered back into the Fog in the east, on a special mission from Cenware, led by [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_crow_eye_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed], Cenware’s personal Magi.\n\n     At Kresox’s Grave it is said that Arch-Legon [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_kresox_var').Char.GetFirstName] surrendered the four remaining legions under his command and all his servants as slaves to Cenware in return for his own safe passage. Cenware and the Sjalvolki were not ones for slavery, and it is said that the Witch-Breaker accepted the terms. He then declared that as the owner of the legionaries and Kresox’s followers, he ordered them to lay down their weapons and live lives of peace. He then freed them all from slavery, and in an ironic punishment for his cowardice, had Kresox ‘safely escorted’ to his former slaves. They then tore him limb from limb, ending the last organized resistance to the Sjalvolki in Kalathipsomi.\n\n     He briefly fought north and south, tribes settling or preparing to take the most fertile lands to the south. They also freed great numbers of slaves, recruiting even more people into the Imperrech as they broke the chains that held them.\n\n     Nicanoneus fought Cenware in several losing battles in the north, forced to work with the northern rivals, Governor [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_methiad_var').Char.GetFirstName] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_methiad_var').Char.GetDynastyName] and [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_oulnir_var').Char.GetFirstName] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_oulnir_var').Char.GetDynastyName] in their [Concept('the_black_mountain_war', 'Black Mountain War')|E] for men and supplies to battle Cenware. He would gain the only victory in battle against Cenware himself in history at the Battle of Bergkoga. Cenware would reverse this however and drive Nicanoneus back north in subsequent battles, who blamed his allies and struck down Governor Dethlycan and Gurdurbok, taking control of the Black Mountains. He would then invade west into Chevalie in the [ash_war|E], fighting a long and gruelling campaign against the Chevaliens and their unexpected allies in the arriving Partic Calagonii, who had broken off from the Imperrech for unknown reasons. Nicanoneus faced defeat and a Partic Magi disfigured him with fire during the last battles.\n\n     Nicanoneus was not the greatest of swordsmen, but he was an expert tactician and politician. He turned his disfigurement into propaganda, having a mask forged from glass and his armor done in Aversarian colors of black, gold and red. He declared he had, in fact, been born on the day of an eclipse, and that on the day of his birth the Purest himself handed him to his family before a crowd of weeping First Men. The Purest had sent him from the heavens to one day rule Aversaria, and he named himself [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_nicanoneus_var').Char.GetNickname].\n\n     His legions were in tatters, his nobles unruly, the natives increasingly unsure of their alliance, and his own children despised him for his cold and unflinching parenting. They said that Nicanoneus only felt emotion once in his life, when he met a camp follower on the campaign and immediately fell in love. Her death in childbirth would mean he would never love another, especially not his children, each of whom he viewed as a unique failure. Nicanoneus declared that no matter how likely he was to fail against the Sjalvolki, they would know his name before his death.\n\n     Aversaria seemed in her final death rattles when the realm united for one last effort. The Sjalvolki marched south in significant force, preparing to cross into Etepezea and the Aversarian heartland. The remaining State Legions of Aversaria organized a grand army from hundreds of warlords, local forces, mercenaries, and other rogue legions. The largest gathering of Aversarian soldiers in history would march north to stop the Sjalvolki at a place named the Elysian Pass, along with the last remaining elite and non-partisan forces of Aversaria.\n\n     Many scholars named what followed, the Battle of the Elysian Pass, as the day that Aversaria died. An unmitigated disaster, the Sjalvolki would play the disunited Aversarians against one another and Cenware’s Magi would unleash the Fog on the unsuspecting legions, many of which had refused to even believe that the Fog was real. Not only this, but Eofwine’s force appeared out of the Fog and into Malcois, where they cut off much of the Aversarian’s reinforcements and opened a second front with which flanked the attacking force. Nearly every legion that fought was so damaged that they would disband after the fighting, an entire generation of Aversarian soldiers dying in a single day. The Sjalvolki would face losses in the low hundreds.\n\n     With the path clear, the Sjalvolki began their great migration into Aversaria. The Sjalvolki claim that the Witch-Breaker was the only one who refused to celebrate their brilliant victory. Contemporaries would claim he had spoken a melancholy poem about the death of so old an Empire, evil or not, upon watching the legions collapse at the Pass.\n\n     [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_rene_var').Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_rene_var').Char.GetDynastyName] would be one of the few survivors from the Aversarian side of the conflict. The bastard son of High King [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_gardfrei_var').Char.GetFirstName] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_gardfrei_var').Char.GetDynastyName] of [chevalie|E], he had left his homelands in order to lead mercenaries abroad, which had become the Marcher’s staple export. At the Elysian Pass the Aversarians had hired him and his Band of Bastards to battle the Sjalvolki, but they ended up forced to cut through both sides to escape the Fog.\n\n     The Fog had consumed their fellow Marchers in the Company of the Crownman’s Sword, however. Réné and his men would turn and fight their way back to their fellow mercenaries and then cut a way out together. Legends claim Cenware saluted Réné for this from across the field, declaring the Marchers to be the ‘only men he fought that day‘."

Gardfrei declared his intentions to go on a great and mysterious quest to the north, that seemed to consume more and more of him as the years passed and time went on. As he aged, his court and his children demanded that he declare his successor, for Chevalie did not simply pass from ruler to child, instead it went to whoever could prove best at protecting the Marcher people.\n\n     Gardfrei famously took his crown from his head, broke it to pieces in his hands, and threw them at his scheming court. He declared whoever pieced it back together could wear it for all he cared and then disappeared on his mysterious journey north with many knights and companions.\n\n     Chevalie collapsed in the aftermath, for Chevalie is a land which only the strongest may rule. While it has laws and tradition, and High Kings strive for legal claim and authority, the right of power ultimately guides succession. If one can not hold their throne, what hope do they have against Liches or the always threatening Magi? And if they can not legitimize it, what hope do they have to unite the realm in crisis? With Gardfrei gone with no clear heir, and a history of endless civil wars for the highest throne ending in its multi-century dissolution, Gardfrei’s children fought, and Réné landed upon her shores and declared his intentions to reunite the throne.\n\n     In the south, however, the Marchers had thrived. World renowned mercenaries and Anti-Magi, foreigners could find Marcher merchants and sellswords in every port where there was a war. Across Sarradon they and the Aversarians both had made great gains in tearing riches from the native Sarradonians, and the influx of Agionists and their breaking from Aversaria had led to the destruction of the final Ritualist warlords.\n\n     [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_harthah_var').Char.GetFirstName] [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_harthah_var').Char.GetDynastyName], however, declared it the time for the [Concept('wardenism','Wardenites')|E] to begin a grand age of resistance. His master, Mamur [GetGlobalVariable('gh_doc_adabyn_var').Char.GetFirstName], disagreed, however. He called for caution, pointing out that the Continentals would devour themselves, and that the Wardenites needed to recover and strike when the moment was right. Ḥārthah was his greatest and most loyal general, but broke with the Mamur when the Agionist Order of Saint Calysto’s Key captured his wife and forced her into slavery in their plantations of ‘petinents’. Ḥārthah begged to be given a force to rescue her, but when Adabyn yet again guided caution, he gathered up the men himself and struck.\n\n     The Agionists would defeat him after he discovered his wife already dead, and they threw him into the sea to die. Somehow, he survived and washed up in eastern Sarradon, then escaped from chasing Agionist and Imperial patrols to the deserts where he took shelter with the nomadic tribes. The desert people had once risen in a great wave and used great and strange magics, and pledged to support Ḥārthah if he would return the lands of the east which they had once conquered.\n\n     Ḥārthah agreed, and they formed a great alliance that rapidly conquered the remains of the Aversarian colonies and drove back the Agionist orders, declaring his name to be ibn Sarradon and all the south his children. What opposes him, however, is dark and unknown. Maybe once greed had corrupted the Agionists, or the Aversarians, or extremism and zealotry, but now something darker seemed to pull the strings. The Order of the Forgotten Saint controlled all other orders, but many wondered who controls the puppet masters.\n\n     Some say that one day the northerners will rule the Shattered Coast and form a hundred new cultures and religions to supplant the old. That they will settle into castles like those they conquered and declare new feudal orders inspired by the Chevaliens. That the Wardenites will defeat the Agionists and the Ritualists will rise in a great new wave of rebellion. And that the Fog may one day stop, or more likely consume the world."
