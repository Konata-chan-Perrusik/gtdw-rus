An order of [magi|E] smiths, they work to keep the stories and practices of the Karzarad alive. The Keepers are decentralized, periodically moving throughout the diaspora of the Karzarad people to better fulfill their purpose. \n\nThe school is defined by an odd dichotomy of magical knowledge, as the Keepers are well-versed in the practical applications of the spells they store, ranging from intricate mechanical constructs crafted by their people to the various diseases said to have been used by cruel tyrants in the oldest legends - causing them to develop expertise in [aspect_metal|E] and [aspect_nature|E] spells."

In the eastern part of the continent this took the form of the so-called School of Esoterics, an alliance of Magi academies and non-associated masters who based their studies upon a surviving corpus of texts centered around the practice of certain arts pertaining to those [arcana|E] who were considered to be "above" the affairs daily mortal life; namely [aspect_celestial], [aspect_dark], and [aspect_dream]."

Then comes the voice, coming to the would-be practitioner from a nearly-invisible presence lurking just behind their shoulder, whispering truths into their left ear which fade with the rising dawn. Those Magi with the volition to listen (or those too weak-willed to shut the dreams out) soon find occult revelations spring to their mind, the culminations of the tutelage provided by the Presence in the Mirror. Originating in Sarradon, it is thought to be spread through 'infected' texts to particularly susceptible Magi. Having wormed its way across [aeras|E] like a cancer visitations have now occurred as far afield as the [Concept('the_continent','Continent')|E].\n\nTo those Magi who do listen, the Presence provides teachings in the [arcana|E] of [aspect_dark], [aspect_air], and [aspect_dream].

The vindictive and hostile woods-spirits who guard these places speak of an ancient age where the forest spread across the whole of northern Sarradon; a time of ancient and terrible god-kings and older magics.\n\nThe Greenwenders are said to be the last remnants of that magic, which has otherwise been lost to time and the advancement of civilization. Derided in high society as dirty and strange, the Greenwenders operate in secretive fraternities scattered across the countryside of Central Sarradon."

For while modern retellings will often use the word "Magi", the more accurate translation of that ancient term would be 'Practitioner of the Luminous Discipline'. And while the Sarradonian cultures that inhabit most of the peninsula might view this as a mere quirk of language, to the Dezhunic peoples of the Kharadamatian interior, it means something far greater.\n\nBecause to them, that Luminous Discipline is still practiced as in the ancient stories. While not a well-defined system of magic like is practiced by their Sarradonian neighbors, or the Aversarians across the sea, these ancient rites still hold sway over the forces of [aspect_light] and [aspect_fire], and will continue to do so for as long as those stories are told."

 sungazers_desc:0 "In Aekershaan magic has always been heavily linked to Ohrasik, with most Ahridarists believing he is the source of all magic. Magi of the region are known as sungazers, as they attempt to divine the will of Ohrasik through careful observation of the sun. These observations almost always inevitably lead to pronouncements of the great victories Ohrasik is making in battling the forces of darkness.\n\nDrawing on the powers of [aspect_light], [aspect_fire], and occasionally [aspect_blood], sungazers can field devastating magical attacks. During times of peace, however, they turn their magic to more constructive efforts, mediating sunlight to promote plant growth."

Though derided as "hedge magi" or "drunken pagans" by their detractors in the more formalized and urban Aversarian schools of Magi, even those critics must admit that the rites of the Magi of the Cup seem to instill a deep and almost instinctual command over the secrets of [aspect_water] and [aspect_air]."

The two words which name the loosely-defined school serve to emphasize the role played by these practitioners in society, and to combine the great knowledge which they access with the duty owed to their communities and rulers.\n\nIn practical terms, Singers of the Songs are expected to combine an ancient set of practical rituals to control the natural environment with a masterful knowledge of the world's will—manifesting as a famed ability to both predict and influence events yet to pass. Despite the less-prestigious role played by [magi|E] compared to some other cultures, even Aversarian scholars have been impressed by the command of [aspect_light], [aspect_nature], and even [aspect_dream] Magic displayed by some practitioners."

Most famed—and feared—of this magical underworld's secrets are the Chants of the Tomb, which promise their Singers a twisted form of powers once belonging only to the Most High.\n\nHighly esoteric, this long-suppressed branch of Damotan magic focuses on understanding the elementary mechanics of life, and has supposedly been responsible for all manner of monstrosities. Nonetheless, there will likely always be a small contingent delving further into the mysteries of [aspect_death], [aspect_ethereal], and [aspect_blood] magic."

Nonetheless, practicality has demanded that Damotan rulers attempt to foster an understanding of these foreign ways of magic.\n\nIn radical divergence from the rest of Damota’s magical traditions, the Singers of the Dirges are focused on the use of magic in battle, and countless shattered walls, burned villages, and fallow fields mark the trail of these practitioners. Yet, so long as there is war in Damota, there will be demand for these death-bringers, who combine a traditional knowledge of [aspect_nature] with the [aspect_fire] and [aspect_stone] of the North."

Practitioners specialize in [aspect_water]-based spells and are famed for their versatility in wielding it.

Elevating glass as formless [aspect_air] refined through the artistry of [aspect_metal], its practitioners see themselves as ever-shifting vessels shaped by the sum of their skills and experiences, striving to further refine themselves through mastery over their chosen field of expertise.\n\nQuasiphilosophical and semireligious, the Temple has no formal structure or hierarchy; instead, it is composed of small, individualistic schools centered around a particular Magi—often of significant renown—and their students. This decentralization, in turn, fosters heterodoxy, and it is not uncommon for any two separate schools to espouse seemingly incompatible teachings."

Although the school initially considered divination a valid source of knowledge, early disputes have since revised their position on visionary techniques.\n\nThis school has since developed a relatively coherent atomic system of describing reality, using the terms like substances, qualities, and additional ontological categories. While Empiricists are not materialists, their stance on epistemology has caused them to excel primarily in the manipulation of the physical world, resulting in a renowned tradition of elemental magic focusing on the aspects of [aspect_fire], [aspect_water] and [aspect_stone]."
