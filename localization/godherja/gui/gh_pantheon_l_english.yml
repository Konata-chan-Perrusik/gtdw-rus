 FAITH_PANTHEON_EXPLANATION:0 "The Uakakloh worship a myriad of gods and demons, and are guided in doing so by the temple orders, each dedicated to a specific being. Though the last time that many of the orders were functional lies long before living memory, or even before the historical record, those that remain continue in their functions, and offer great boons in exchange for patronage, hoping to obtain aid in their supplication. A wise Uakakloh ruler would work with them, for their religious authority and status as some of the most powerful institutions among the Uakakloh could yield great rewards for their allies."
 
 #STARTING UAKAKLOH TEMPLES
 izcatotl_name:0 "Scarred Priesthood - Izcatotl"
 izcatotl_desc:0 "The Scarred Priesthood of Izcatotl devote themselves to the appeasement of the Flayed Mother of the Uakakloh, Goddess of Pain, Torture, and Blood. In the distant past, it is whispered that she would receive prisoners as sacrifices, before [mavixars_curse|E] barred them from such appeasement. Nonetheless, her priesthood continues the practice of human sacrifice, albeit as a hidden ritual, performed only upon the deeply-initiated members of their order, who spend their lives training to accompany her in Kuatlan, the realm of the gods.\n\nAs an order, the Scarred Priesthood are known for their distinctive and self-inflicted patterns of sculpted wounds, carved in rituals meant to appease the bloodlust of their god. This sacrifice, so they claim, has been enough to keep their brothers-in-faith alive in the brutal environment of Cyrat, lending them the strength to survive the harsh environment."
 zlatotec_name:0 "Bloodcrystal Sword Society - Zlatotec"
 zlatotec_desc:0 "The Bloodcrystal Sword Society is dedicated to the worship of the Sky Hunter, who chases monsters across the void above in the form of comets, and eternally fights against the demons of Totoakuatlan. Through their adoration, they believe that he will lend them strength, or withdraw his fortune from their enemies. The offerings made to him are varied, but the most famous of them all is the duelist.\n\nWithin the Bloodcrystal Swords, there is a traditional ritualistic duel, of which the winner will be sacrificed to Zlatotec as the most worthy. Many within the priesthood spend their entire lives training for these duels, and their losers are often known to instead swear themselves to the military branch of the Bloodcrystal Swords, serving under local warlords and chieftains to regain their lost honor and bring support to the temples they hail from."
 alitikatl_name:0 "Initiates of the Higher Mysteries of Alitikatl"
 alitikatl_desc:0 "Alitikatl was born from the tears of Tensese, as he watched the world descend into chaos with the onslaught of demons, spawned in reaction to his creation. As those tears formed a pool upon the earth, Alitikatl stood up, and began his search. Soon, he found mankind, huddling within primitive huts, and chose from among them the most worthy; upon whom the title of Ayi-Tlacatolalli, or Magical King, was bestowed. With the guidance of Alitikatl, the Tlaklakan crafted their ancient civilization.\n\nIn the modern age, with the Uakakloh once again forced to hide from predators, his worship has taken on a new character entirely. Instead of praising his past glories, the priests of the Initiates of the Higher Mysteries of Alitikatl desperately ask that he aid his current followers, and devote themselves to mysterious magical rituals hoping to invoke his power to return the ancient lines of [magi|E]-Kings. In a less fatalistic manner, they have also used their skills to tutor the children of nearby Uakakloh [magi|E], hoping to bestow the lessons of Alitikatl upon future generations, that perhaps a new golden age might dawn."
 huatipotchl_name:0 "Weeping Ones - Huatipotchl"
 huatipotchl_desc:0 "Huatipotchi is the god, or perhaps demon, of Wrath and Rage. Traditionally depicted as a skeletal figure with rubies for eyes, the Weeping Ones forever make offerings to attempt to convince him to focus his attention on the other divine beings, rather than inflicting suffering upon humanity. They expect not to receive boons from their divine patron, but rather to provide whatever they can to protect humanity, though occaisonally they will recognize a specific military action as being the will of Huatipotchi.\n\nHuman sacrifice is practiced by the deepest initiates of the Weeping Ones, conducting elaborate court rituals meant to show proper supplication before the Wrath Wielder, ending with the elaborate suicide of the priests in order to join their patron as a servant in the realms of the divine. In this sense, they are often regarded as one of the last links to a way of life long since left behind."
 naxhuicazal_name:0 "Priesthood of the Rotten - Naxhuicazal"
 naxhuicazal_desc:0 "With the collapse of the [necentlal_tlaklaktli|E], the Uakakloh were forced to flee into the depths of the Cyratian jungles, where diseases unknown to any other part of the world ravaged them. Desperate, they turned to the demon Naxhuicazal, and began desperately pleading that he call back his swarms, and let the faithful live unmolested. They began offering him their bodies, casting the mortally sick into His temples as offerings, and seperating them from the rest of the population.\n\nIronically when one considers their patron, the Priesthood of the Rotting focuses itself on preventing disease, conducting strange cleansing rituals in order to convince the Lord of Flies to strike elsewhere. They consider it their task to identify the sick and take them in for treatment, isolating those whom Naxhuicazal has called from all others, believing their death of disease can be converted into a sacrifice."
 nyanunwhaxi_name:0 "Shadowless - Nyanunwhaxi"
 nyanunwhaxi_desc:0 "Nyanunwhaxi accompanies the soul into the afterlife, judging them based upon their actions in life. Unconventionally for most pantheonic faiths, she is regarded by the Uakakloh as one of the kindest divine beings, waiting patiently to take them into paradise, away from their earthly sufferings. She is held to be impressed by great artworks and tombs, and though the resources of the contemporary faithful are pitiful compared to their past, they still make every effort to impress her.\n\nThe Shadowless, her priesthood, spearheads some of the last true construction projects of the Uakakloh, building tombs and monuments to the fallen in hopes of attracting the Waiting Mother's mercy. Additionally, though they do not practice sacrifice, the deepest initiates of their order instead consume carefully-measured amounts of poison, believing that getting near to death will allow them to commune with Nyanunwhaxi."
 tzitihuyqui_name:0 "Followers of the Verdant Path of Tzitihuyqui"
 tzitihuyqui_desc:0 "Tzitihuyqui once bestowed two gifts upon humanity. First, she gave them agriculture, that they could grow and spread. But secondly, she gave them art, that they could give her praise. Ever since have her followers walked the Verdant Path of the Five Alluring Pleasures; though after the migration to Cyrat the Three Exquisite Torments gradually found their way into doctrine.\n\nThe Followers are well-known for their intricately decorated costumes and masks, worn in both glorious celebrations and within dark torture chambers. Though from the outside, their form of worship seems to be mostly peaceful, focused on music and the painting of murals, the deepest levels of their order are steeped in blood, with the highest initiates subjecting themselves to horrific tortures to create an art of suffering, which is often held as the reason why the Uakakloh face their present challenges. Should they complete this highest, darkest task, they believe that Tzitihuyqui will once more teach mankind the secrets of life."
 mawhunotolotl_name:0 "Cult of the First Hero - Mawhunotolotl"
 mawhunotolotl_desc:0 "Mawhunototl gazes down upon the humanity he left behind with a promise. A promise that heroism carries its rewards. For in the distant past, he too was but a mortal, scrounding out an existence in the misty days of the past. One day, however, the Sun drew too close to the Earth, and seeing no action from the gods, he raised his spear and threw it at the great orb, warding it away. As a reward, he was granted the gift of godhood by Tensese, and ascended into the heavens as the god of duty and bravery.\n\nHis tale has long resonated with the Uakaloh, promising them all a heavenly salvation, and none more embody that hope than the Cult of the First Hero. This temple order functions less as a priesthood and more as a training center, raising children from young ages to become champions, who will then be sent into the jungles to fight off the horrific monsters of Cyrat, hoping that such acts will prove them worthy of joining the gods. The prowess of these lifelong fighters is renowned across Cyrat, and though they are officially held for a holy purpose, in reality they are often sent to the aid of Uakakloh chieftains, though sometimes with a heavy price."
