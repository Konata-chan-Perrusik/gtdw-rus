As the numerically superior imperial force advanced on the Ja'Rakmari positions, a series of sudden avalanches split the army into three disorganized pieces that were individually picked off by the [GetMaA('kanpahuri').GetName] skirmishers. The Astilik emperor and many of his nobles perished in the fighting, enabling [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('jarakmar_ertomax_16').GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] to extract untold tribute under the threat of advancing into the Astilik heartlands.#!"

The road was laid in the 5th century, and has seen little development since besides locals, soldiers moving between Imperial forts, and merchants avoiding the main highway for one reason or another.\n\nIt was here that the Witch-Breaker met 26 [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] legions, plus thousands of auxiliary troops from Aversaria and abroad, in what was the single largest congregation of Aversarian soldiers in recent memory as well as the first sign of Imperial unity against the Sjalvolki since the beginning of the [Concept('sjalvolki_migration','Migrations')|E]. It was also here that only four legions managed to limp away, the majority of the soldiers sent north never to return, and with the Sjalvolki army nearly untouched.\n\nTravelers generally avoid the area, believing it to be haunted or worried that the Sjalvolki use of [Concept('mixed_magic','Fog Magic')|E] may have poisoned the land. Those that do generally find the lack of anything remarkable the most remarkable feature of the area, though armor, weapons, and bones litter the countryside.#!"

There is nothing truly mystical about this place, and at most it has served as a minor shrine to various tribal faiths that have at some point called the area home. To the majority of those who have known of it in history, the clearing has served for little more than a traveler's roadmark, the natural equivalent to a roadside signpost — that is, until the famous [battle_of_ten_trees|E] took place in its vicinity.#!"
