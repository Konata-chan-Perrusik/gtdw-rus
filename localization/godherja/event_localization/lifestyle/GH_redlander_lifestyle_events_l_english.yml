Setting down my weapons, I make my way to the front gate to assess the situation. Upon reaching the gate, the stranger dismounts from [great_commander.GetHerHis] horse and drags forward two captives. "Greetings [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFirstName] [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetDynasty.GetName], my name is [great_commander.GetFirstName]. I wish to aid you in your campaign to cleanse these lands of these filthy Redrunner scum. As a gift and a token of my sincerity, I bring you these two pieces of human filth. Do with them as you like.""
