Продлилось всего несколько часов, и вот уже гордость Авверсарии бежала, поджав хвосты, как будто за нами сам ад гнался. Думаю, так и было. Они схватили нашу Леганку, подняли ее перед всеми нами, прежде чем ее отец из Девятнадцатого бросился вперед. Я видел это, пока мы пытались снова выстроиться с остальными.

I know, I'm a younger lad, I ain't got stories like some of the old folks, but trust me! I got the greatest story of them all, and its about how I learnt to grow the best beets. Clan Aerdonorg I was, with the Fenvir, though not with Cormag and the lot who went to Asiupoli. Stuck with the Witch-Breaker, me and the family did. Went with him into Aversaria.\n\n"My story begins in the Grey Passes, saw me an old chieftain from the Mastikigni about to slip and fall off a ledge, I did. Grabbed him by the wrist and hauled him up even though I was just a tike, and he was so amazed by the fact I could grab him and that I acted so fast, especially since his own clan hardly reached him when I did, that he declared me to be a huscarl! Apparently had to pay a lot to old Cormag back when he was the high chief of the Fenvir, and my family, but I was begging them to let me go and they did.\n\n"And so there I was, only just got the first hair on my chin and I'm the huscarl to the high chief o' the Mastikigni! Went with 'em to the Clanlands, and chopped my way through Aversaria with the lot. Battle of the Ten Trees, hear of it? Overshadowed by the Pass I 'spose, but that was the big one. Aversarian brute, clad in red armor they said was her enemy's blood, ever hear of her? The Bloodletter of Lesus, Xenas the Render, the Butcher of the Barki, aye, her! At least someone heard of her. They even called her Xenas 'Name-Taker' for all the named men and women she killed. Not sure if you know yourself, but Sjalvolki nicknames are an important thing. To become named is to become a warrior, a man, a woman. Fought hard for my name, and it's nothing even that great, just 'Sun-in-the-Eye' cause it always seemed like I had to loose towards the sun. But to give an Aversarian a name? Means they're of note, means they're worthy of a fight.\n\n"Battle of the Ten Trees. Well, there were a lot more than ten, though there were eleven in the clearing where it all went down. Wasn't even meant to be a fight, wasn't at all. Clan was camping for the night, Aversarians were falling back to a fortress after dodging an ambush we didn't even know the Kardwen devils had thrown together. They ran straight into us, literally! Had my eyes half-closed, drifting off lookin' at the campfire, when suddenly an Aversarian tripped and stumbled through my campfire!\n\n"Was right panicked I was. No idea how the sentries didn't catch 'em. Either sleeping or dead, both of 'em from that side got killed in the fight so no way to tell, though we all said killed to honor them. One second I'm sleeping, next I got Aversarians in my leftover stew! Jumped up right then the second I saw the blood symbols, ain't no Sjalvolki wearing those, and hit the bastard with my hammer so hard it sent the helmet inside-out! Next thing I know and it's chaos, got my bow but could hardly use it, was cock to ass with a hundred hardened Aversarians.\n\n"Oh the names that fell at the Eleven Trees, named for the number of trees in our camp. Ulfric 'Shout-Maker' got his name there, as did Eylrig 'of the Queer-Eyes', Ilya 'Lover-Killer' and Desisjalva 'Man-Slayer'. Drazhic 'Metal-Maker' fell, Dragonic 'Iron-Hewer', his brother, got his name after dying there for somehow stabbing a sword through plate before he went down. Aversarians too. The Crotyrosian Cult they called themselves, the Magi who were leading the lot. Dexos 'the Old One', fancy-like Tesca 'Reeve Reaver', 'Archmagi' or whatever Gosti 'Heathen-Lover'. Non-Magi too, Dragos 'the Dragon', Le- leg- legone... General Mescranax of the... 38th legion? Mescranax the 'Pure of Pure', the Marcher they had too, Sir Melthew 'of the Rose and Swan' or whatever. Killed the lot.\n\n"People only forget it because of Elysia, biggest gathering of names ever at the point, all by accident. And we gave 'em hell! Crossed arms with Melthew himself before that Magi exploded... Reeve Reaver I think, got her arm cut off mid-spell and turned half the battlefield into a crater. Then it was me and High Chief Ulradd, that was Mastikigni man I followed. Saw him cut off across the field in the mess and without a single of his huscarls around to honor him! Disgrace it was, though I guess I had already been showing the Mastikigni how to treat their chief! Haha!\n\n"So I ran out, jumped onto some crates, somehow vaulted over at least six helmets. Not even joking! If I was lying I'd do it about somethin' more impressive than a jump. Landed right on top of another name, the traitor, Uloven 'the Aversarian'. Mondecny bastard never even saw me comin', landed right on top of him and crushed him in. It was a mess, but warriors were crowding every slicked bit of mud we were stumbling on. That was the benefit, legions still usin' the old tactics. Wanted to form lines and have their Magi hit us, but we knew we had the advantage all close like that and so we pressed them in.\n\n"That's when she was there, The Bloodletter of Lesus herself. She marched through the crowd like a beast on the prowl, saw the high chief and saw her target and went in. You know how tall the bitch was!? Two heads taller than everyone else, swear to Velos and Prohen, I swear it to be true. They say she was born twisted and backwards, two legs the wrong way and only one arm. Used magic to fix herself, her pa' was a Magi or some such and died cause he bled himself so much to make her so big. Damn Aversarians, can't just accept things are what they are...\n\n"She used a spell to knock a bunch of lads out, only two were standing between her and the high chief, two other huscarls. Two grown men, one the size of a bear, and she somehow grabs both by the heads and slams them together. Grabs her axe from where she dropped it and marched forward. Huge battleaxe, longer than I was, held in one hand. The other hand goes up and points at the high chief, and I knew evenough Aversarian by then to hear her shout, "#!"You! Come and fight me, low-blood!" Scared the shit out of me, it did.\n\n"Bloodletter prepped up her axe in both hands and swung just as the high chief turned, and I tackled him! Got him to the ground and dragged him up before she slammed the axe so hard into the mud that it hit rock. Bloodletter was so mad she screamed and went for me, don't even know how I survived it. Screamed at me, screamed at me and yelled, "#!"I'm going to grind you heathens into dust, and your bones and blood will fertilize the fields! You are good for nothing else!" and then charged me with the axe.\n\n"No reason to live, no reason honestly. I'm proud, hell proud! But I ain't nothing like the Bloodletter. But just then, just then her boot slips, right through the mud. Impossible, no chance to happen, and it happens just then. Knew Velos was smiling on me then, me and the high chief both ran and tackled her to the ground. Even at her size, being on the ground is a hell of a thing, and two other huscarls ran in to help out. Turns out the armor wasn't bloody, just painted, but it sure as hell was covered in gore when we finished her off! Real bitch she was, but earned her name I think. Warrior that deadly? Certainly gotta earn somethin' behind their death. Wonder if the Aversarian's fight with Velos...\n\n"Anyway, so that's the story. What? The crops? I told you how I learnt to grow beets! High chief told me that I'd earned my fill, said I was a damn fine young lad who deserved to be a chief myself. Gave me an old castle we passed that I said was pretty, gave me thirty men to go start a settlement, and named me a chief of the Mastikigni. Ol' Ulradd was a generous one, that's for sure... hope he's alright... but still. And beets? Remember, the Bloodletter told me, grind bones and flesh to fertilize the plants. Wasn't a bad idea! My land was only a quick trek from the Ten Trees, and let me tell you, with the Bloodletter's help the beets have never grown larger! Ha!"#!"

Wasn't doing much fighting after that... was my first battle, too. Only battle, really... couldn't really fight accountin' on my leg, more the pity... was gonna be something once. Guess not though, guess not... Battle of Bergkoga, hear of it? Not surprised if you didn't, nobody right cares about it.

Had to pull back... boulder came down and pinned my leg to the cliff, had to drag me away without it... a campaign where we won every single battle, and my first one some two-bit Aversarian warlord in black armor masquering as a fucking god takes my leg with a rock in the only battle my general loses.

All the old ruins with that fat Legon Kresox sittin' there, haha!\n\n"Had earned myself a bit o' distinction in the last tumble, so they let me stand up in the front to see the surrender. Kresox was a talker, made me wish I hadn't learned Aversarian! Rambled on and on about he fought with honor and blood and blah, blah, blah. Maybe I'm just young and don't know much on accountin' of respecting my elders, but by Velos he just talked!\n\n"Funniest bit was when he then gave all his legions as slaves to Cenware in return for his safe treatment by the 'Lowbloods' he called us. Haha! Should have seen the look on all his general's faces. Don't think he told a one. Mescranax nearly fuckin' jumped him! Was hilarious, bunch of his men had to drag him to the ground, 'Pure o' the Pure' they called him and got dragged down into the mud by his clansmen! Haha!\n\n"Anyway, got even funnier. All these Aversarians just got made slaves, and all these ol' slaves standing there too. Not Aversarians, meaning. Poor lot who look like they hadn't eaten in their lives and ain't a single look of hope or emotion in a one, like a bunch of undead or something. Don't get why they didn't just fight back, can they really say they don't deserve to be a slave if they don't fight? I'dunno, but others saw it different, ain't gonna fault them. Not like I know anything about how that works. Ain't ever owned a thraell.\n\n"Right, right, so they're all slaves, and Cenware says yes! Kresox looked so happy, fat pig with folds so big they were spillin' over his chair. Couldn't even fit his armor! Could tell they had to have a smith stretch it for him to get into it. Holds out his broach of office to the Witch-Breaker and has his slave hand his sword. Cenware takes both and then tosses them over his shoulder! Ha!\n\n"So Cenware, and 'ere is the best part, Cenware then looks at all the soldiers and slaves he just got. Then he looks at them and says as their master, his commands gotta last for life. So he looks at all these legion boys, and let me tell you, they're all ready to cry! Bunch of 'em look like they want to jump the Witch-Breaker there and then but most you can tell thought we were gonna eat them like Kardwen or something! Haha! So Cenware looks over and says his command is the law for the rest of their lives, and then tells them, ""As the master and owner of your flesh and soul, I order you to learn a trade other than war, to put down your weapons and pick up the hoe, the pitchfork. Go on and live as men and women far from war, and never think of fighting one again.""\n\n"Soldiers all froze, nobody knew what to do! Hahaha! We knew Cenware of course, knew he wouldn't kill 'em or anything like that. Even if we thought we mind as well have, Aversarians being bunch o' bastards and all. Anyway, knew he wouldn't, but they didn't! Aversarians thought Cenware was a demon himself! So he tells them all to live in peace and they look all surprised, then he turns to the slaves and tells them they are all hereby freed from their chains and, if they wanted to, would be welcomed as brother's into the clans of the Imperrech. Slaves look even more confused, some started crying then, others started praying to the Witch-Breaker himself! Haha!\n\n"Anyway, anyway. So Kresox is startin' to realize something ain't right here. He starts telling Cenware that uh, how'd the sun-melted oversized wax fatty looking Aversarian put it... "#!"I understand you are of lesser blood and mind, Cenware, but allow me to instruct you of the necessity for control. These slaves are unruly, the ones cheering, and perhaps your proclamation was somethin' somethin' very wise, cause the rebellious slaves all picked out to kill. Regardless, I wish not to be near these fools when you transport me to my kin."\n\n"Idiot, farkin' idiot! Hahaha! Cenware looked at the slaves and asked which of 'em was born Aversarian, told him he wouldn't hurt or rescind his offer and a few stepped forward. Then he looks at all of us and goes, "#!"Kresox, as I promised, I return you to your countrymen! They may do with you, as my new clansmen whatever they wish." Tore the fucking idiot limb from limb! Ahaha! Thought the slaves had no fight, but Kresox screamed an' tried to scramble away, Cenware kicked 'm right in the chin and sent him on his back, and in they went! Ahaha!\n\n"While Kresox is gettin' torn limb from limb, he then looks at the legions and their leaders and he tells them that his order to lay down their arms will go for life, but he thereby freed them from slavery and of their bonds. Then told them to get out of there, had us break them up across the Clanlands and sent them to farms, and most never fought again. Ahaha! Greatest day of the campaign, loved it even more than the Elysian Pass! Ahaha! Knew that moment, just a youngster I am, knew just at that moment that life in the south would be the good life."#!"

Legion marched by my village, was one kid of twenty and the crops hadn't grown that year, so options were to let my family eat me for food or join the legion and try to get them some.\n\n"Lost it all. Lost it all. Was so proud to be in the Proudest, so proud. Just a boy... still am I guess, but I was young. Didn't know all the stories about our ancestors were just that, stories.

Lucky the men had enough discipline to follow the order, or else they wouldn't have tackled Mescranax when he ran for him.\n\n"Of course, I'm sure you know how the rest went. Freed us all, threw Krasox to the slaves and let the fat bastard be ripped shred by shred. Idiotic, of course. Give a master to their slaves and all you do is teach them to never respect their betters, but that was that. I had been made a slave, and the Witch-Breaker had instructed us never to carry arms or fight in war again, and to live a life of peace. The order stands, even if we were freed, such is the rights of a slave. And so I've lived through the decades since, never to dare to carry a sword again. The first time was far too exhausting, regardless..."#!"

Had my youth, didn't have half a brain, but I had my youth. Bronze Cities I was with, oh how proud they were. Now nobody even knows what the Bronze Cities are. Guess that's what they got for naming themselves for some lord's breastplate and not what they actually make.\n\n"Oh I know, nobody likes those who say they fought for the Bloodright in the Clanlands. Either think we were a disgrace or think we were fools. Take no pride in it myself, in the action I mean. Proud to have served, and done somethin' and traveled out of the city for the first time. Sjalvolki? Did what they had to do, how I look at it. The leaders ordered us to stop them, and they needed to get south.\n\n"Some were bitter, but I was with Pathos when we surrendered to the Witch-Breaker. Man could have killed us all, but let us return home in peace... nothing I can call that about honorable, even if some call it weak. Wouldn't have done the same for him at the time... an honorable man, just as we pretended we were. Will never stop being thankful for that."#!"
