 # Updated, short intros specific to monsters, pulled from original intro_descs
 hunt.0520.adze: "[Glossary('Adzes', 'animal_type_adze_encyclopedia_desc')] can be incredibly difficult to hunt, with their variable size, their flight, and their invisibility. When preparing I must take care to always be aware of my surroundings, as I cannot trust my eyes. One mistake and the creature will strike true, drain me dry, leaving only an exsanguinated corpse."
 hunt.0520.akapura: "An [Glossary('Akapura', 'animal_type_akapura_encyclopedia_desc')] is the size of a small island and is encased in a thick shell. Compared to killing such a massive creature, tracking it will be an easy task for our party. Whilst there is little danger of losing sight of the creature, there are no guarantees as to how killing it will proceed."
 hunt.0520.almas: "Many stories tell of how vicious and powerful these [Glossary('almas', 'animal_type_almas_encyclopedia_desc')] can be, and if we're not careful on the mountain paths, it will not take much for the beast to send us hurdling downward to our deaths."
 hunt.0520.apep_ibizan: "The infamous creature known as [Glossary('apep-ibizan', 'animal_type_apep-ibizan_encyclopedia_desc')] is aggressive, intelligent and in many cases supernatural. The people of [kemsar_biozone|E] believe that it is a creature sent by the devil to terrorize them in their time of need. And it certainly seems so. It can detect any person within a certain distance from it, making any kind of stealth useless. It is terrifyingly fast #italics and #! boasts a fighting skill unmatched by most."
 hunt.0520.banshee: "For all the superstitious peasants erroneously branding a local ghost a '[Glossary('banshee', 'animal_type_banshee_encyclopedia_desc')]', the frustrating reality is that a genuine banshee is incredibly unlikely to leave behind direct witnesses of its activities. An encounter with one of these spirits is certain to end with the victim dead in the best of cases, enthralled in the worst, or kept imprisoned as a plaything if fate chooses to be especially cruel."
 hunt.0520.bhramar: "The faint and painful moan of a [Glossary('bhramar', 'animal_type_bhramar_encyclopedia_desc')] is terrifying to hear, turning all but the bravest of travelers away. Whilst a bow might destroy one or two of its many stinging parts, the creature itself would endure and destroy such a hunter. It is said that the bhramar's only weakness is flame, forcing itself to contract into a form mostly resembling its former human self."
 hunt.0520.chimera: "The [Glossary('chimera', 'animal_type_chimera_encyclopedia_desc')] is known to be possessed of a malignant intelligence, and exudes a foul stench. Their breath, most terrible of all the beasts of [aeras|E], induces horrific seizures, paralysis and death. A lucky few escape with their bodies intact, but their minds ravaged and haunted by visions. Only the goat's head may produce this gas, though in response to threat it has been known to produce a thick cloud of the grayish mist, enveloping the chimera and its surroundings."
 hunt.0520.coatl: "The [Glossary('coatl', 'animal_type_coatl_encyclopedia_desc')] is said to be ferocious and strong enough to crush a man with its body. We must prevent it from escaping by flight once attacked if we are to be victorious."
 hunt.0520.cor: "It is said that the [Glossary('Cor', 'animal_type_cor_encyclopedia_desc')] plays tricks on the mind, and one must be swift of thought if they wish to slay it. Otherwise, they may lose themselves in the process."
 hunt.0520.crocotta: "[Glossary('Crocotta', 'animal_type_crocotta_encyclopedia_desc')] clans have been sighted near to where my party roams, preying on local villages. With each moment that passes, the chance that I will hear their horrifying calls becomes ever more likely. They still prowl across the hills as we track them, and it may be that they find us before we find them."
 hunt.0520.devouring_worm: "The [Glossary('Devouring Worm', 'animal_type_devouring_worm_encyclopedia_desc')] is one of the more terrifying creatures to stalk the deserts of this world. Many tend to be small, only a foot or two in length and as thick as a string of sausages, but some are known to grow large enough to devour a man. They burrow under the sands waiting for prey, then they spring out of the ground, swallow as much as possible, and dive back beneath the sands to devour and digest their meal.\n\nDangerous as they are, they are not impossible to hunt."
 hunt.0520.dire_mosquito: "The [Glossary('Dire Mosquito', 'animal_type_dire_mosquito_encyclopedia_desc')] is said to be exceedingly deadly, so we must be careful as we trudge through the thick jungle."
 hunt.0520.djinn: "[Glossary('Djinn', 'animal_type_djinn_encyclopedia_desc')] may seem impossible to hunt, seeing how they do not possess normal corporeal forms, but it can be done through unconventional means. A djinn hunter's arsenal does not come with bows and knives, but tomes of magical lore and prisms crafted from [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] Tarshaf glass. The methods may be esoteric and the risk is great, but the promise of a millennia-old magical servant in one's custody is greatly alluring for many."
 hunt.0520.doyarchu: "The wetlands are alive with the sounds of chirping birds and croaking frogs but the [Glossary('doyarchu', 'animal_type_doyarchy_encyclopedia_desc')] we seek makes no such sound, it lies in wait perfectly still, perfectly silent. In fact as we pass each log or boulder a cold shilver is sent through my spine."
 hunt.0520.dreadleech: "The [Glossary('dreadleech', 'animal_type_dreadleech_encyclopedia_desc')] seems like something from a nightmare, a shadowy monster that will come upon its hapless victim under the cover of night, inflicting a painful and exceedingly slow death. They are large creatures, generally capable of fitting multiple adult humans within them, though they do not kill through eating. Instead, they come upon their prey in the darkness of night, and drain their blood from their body entirely. They prefer to target the sleeping, immobile, or wounded, wandering the deep jungles until they find their victim."
 hunt.0520.false_hydra: "The signs of a [Glossary('false hydra', 'animal_type_false_hydra_encyclopedia_desc')] are clear throughout a near-abandoned settlement. Houses are barred to us as their inhabitants smile and cry at once. The boy that was sent to greet us at the edge of the village was terrified, and yet the same boy wanders around us now with a lopsided smile on his face. The blind song has clearly taken these people."
 hunt.0520.forest_troll: "The [Glossary('forest troll', 'animal_type_forest_troll_encyclopedia_desc')] is the go-to monster of children's' fairy tales and the perpetual bragging point of particularly skilled (or dishonest) hunters. Actual forest troll attacks, however, are quite rare - not because they are not aggressive, which they most assuredly are, but because they simply inhabit the kind of exceptionally dense, primordial woodland that is only found far away from civilization."
 hunt.0520.gajara: "The [Glossary('gajara', 'animal_type_gajara_encyclopedia_desc')] is famed for its rage, furious and ravenous in its hatred. Whilst it appears an elephant at distance, there is no mistaking it to be a bipedal monstrosity when the trees no longer obscure it. It is said that a Gajara's only weakness is its great milky eyes, its skin thicker than any armor."
 hunt.0520.gargoyle: "[Glossary('gargoyles', 'animal_type_gargoyle_encyclopedia_desc')] are exceedingly terrible creatures, though they are thankfully active only in short bursts, being more akin to statues than living creatures when in a dormant state. Though on the surface of it they might seem like an easy enough beast to hunt, one must not forget that they live upon the side of gigantic cliffs that are an ordeal for even the most experienced of mountaineers."
 hunt.0520.gaunt: "The [Glossary('Gaunt', 'animal_type_gaunt_encyclopedia_desc')] is a dangerous opponent, its natural flight makes it difficult to get to grips with, and its tough leathery skin, sharp horns, and vicious claws make it hard to harm even once in close against them. A colony of gaunts is even moreso, with each working in concert to kill intruders, and covering for each other's weaknesses. It is perhaps in their cavernous homes where the greatest opportunity to weaken the gaunt colony arises, with a well placed fire, the colony could be smoked out and dealt with in their confusion."
 hunt.0520.giant: "Scholars debate as to why the fabled [Glossary('giants', 'animal_type_giant_encyclopedia_desc')] of Kalathipsomi seem to be restricted to the province, though most agree that it is likely due to the vast, fruitful primordial forests and abundant dire game making it one of the few places on Aeras where they can still subsist purely on foraging and hunting, even at their scale."
 hunt.0520.giant_bee: "We can see the colossal hive structure from a great distance, though reaching it may be another matter entirely. "
 hunt.0520.giant_spider: "If it weren't for the scattered bones lying on the ground and cocoons hanging off the ceiling, the gigantic spiderweb covering the mouth of the cave where the [Glossary('giant spider', 'animal_type_giant_spider_encyclopedia_desc')] resides in would be nigh-invisible apart from the most subtle of glimmers of reflected light."
 hunt.0520.great_rahksasa: "The [Glossary('great rahksasa', 'animal_type_great_rahksasa_encyclopedia_desc')] is true to its name. After an arduous journey deep into the humid rainforest, we tracked the massive beast easily. Its tracks weren't at all hard to find, nor did the monster seem to care, so confident in its own power."
 hunt.0520.griffon: "The last thing we want is for the [Glossary('griffon', 'animal_type_griffon_encyclopedia_desc')] to strike us unaware and shred us to pieces before we know what happened."
 hunt.0520.karkadann: "The [Glossary('karkadann', 'animal_type_karkadann_encyclopedia_desc')] has little care for the surrounding fauna, as it is well aware of its dominance in the animal world."
 hunt.0520.armazli_rhino: "The great, woolly [Glossary('armazli rhinoceros', 'animal_type_armazli_rhinoceros_encyclopedia_desc')] of [Glossary('Amaghea','amaghea_biozone_encyclopedia_desc')] is said to not hide its tracks at all, confident it can take on any wouldbe attackers."
 hunt.0520.kursha: "A pack of [Glossary('kursha', 'animal_type_kursha_encyclopedia_desc')] are no easy target, even for an experienced hunter. However, the existence of tamed kursha has proven to me that killing one is well within my reach. The strength of the dogs is their pack mentality, overwhelming and flanking their prey, but their advantage is lost when they fight alone."
 hunt.0520.spriggan: "The [Glossary('spriggan', 'animal_type_spriggan_encyclopedia_desc')] has the advantage of camouflage - in its idle state, its woody body completely blends into the surrounding forest."
 hunt.0520.living_blizzard: "The tactics for defeating a [Glossary('living blizzard', 'animal_type_dire_living_blizzard_encyclopedia_desc')] are exceedingly difficult to come by, and separating peasant superstition from genuinely effective methods is even harder."
 hunt.0520.lymrill: "The [Glossary('lymrill', 'animal_type_lymrill_encyclopedia_desc')] is said to be highly intelligent, and incredibly vicious when provoked due to its equally sharp temper. As long as we maintain the element of surprise and strike at a distance with our bows, it will have little time to react, but we must act fast. It will not take long for the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] to disappear back into the wood, and all our efforts will be for naught."
 hunt.0520.manticore: "The difficulty lies not in the tracking of a [Glossary('manticore', 'animal_type_manticore_encyclopedia_desc')], but in slaying the beast. And for that reason, the hunting party accompanying me needs to be a formidable force."
 hunt.0520.myrmeke: "Whilst [cyrat_biozone|E] is full of dangerous creatures, we cannot risk alerting the [Glossary('myrmeke', 'animal_type_myrmeke_encyclopedia_desc')] without preparing ourselves."
 hunt.0520.naga: "The monstrous [Glossary('naga', 'animal_type_naga_encyclopedia_desc')]'s lair should be easy to find by following the trail of flayed human bodies hanging from trees in the jungle."
 hunt.0520.owlbear: "We'll need to act quickly before the [Glossary('owlbear', 'animal_type_owlbear_encyclopedia_desc')] lumbers back into the woods, lest we lose our chance to strike."
 hunt.0520.roaring_lizard: "Whilst fierce and supposedly intelligent, the [Glossary('roaring lizard', 'animal_type_roaring_lizard_encyclopedia_desc')] are huge and will most likely fail to notice my party as we sneak deeper into the jungle in pursuit of them."
 hunt.0520.rock_giant: "A twisted apparition haunting craggy mountain trails, the [Glossary('rock giant', 'animal_type_rock_giant_encyclopedia_desc')] is a monster of both the physical and the spiritual realms. While it takes on the shape of a creature made out of boulders and other stones, its true controller is entombed within - a tortured spirit seeking vengeance against those who inhabit [aeras|E] for what they have done to it."
 hunt.0520.running_raptor: "A [Glossary('running raptor', 'animal_type_running_raptor_encyclopedia_desc')] has been seen in this part of the jungle, and with the trail of broken eggs and bloody nests, I can follow its path. The creature is a deadly hunter, and it will be a challenge to find it before it realises that it's being hunted."
 hunt.0520.shade: "[Glossary('Shades', 'animal_type_shade_encyclopedia_desc')] are, mercifully, rather hard to encounter in most of the world unless one goes out of their way to search of the kind of unnaturally dark places that they normally inhabit. Great pains are made by most societies to root them out whenever they emerge near civilization, as an infestation can easily spiral out of control in the span of a single night and leave an entire settlement decimated."
 hunt.0520.spirit: "Practically every village worth its salt has at least one local haunting, though it might take time to separate the truth from mere fanciful tales. [aeras|E]' history is long and colorful, and places with a storied past are not unlikely to have the [Glossary('spirit', 'animal_type_spirit_encyclopedia_desc')] of an ancient warrior, [magi|E] or ruler from an age long gone still lingering in the waking world on account of some long forgotten, unsettled debt or grudge."
 hunt.0520.tarasque: "The [Glossary('tarasque', 'animal_type_tarasque_encyclopedia_desc')] is a mighty, and incredibly tough foe with a shell as hard as iron, and fuming venomous breath. When dealing with this monstrosity I must prepare to slay it quickly for staying too long within its presence will spell certain doom for me."
 hunt.0520.twin_serpent: "[Glossary('twin-serpent', 'animal_type_twin_serpent_encyclopedia_desc')] have been spotted nearby, and now we seek to best one ourselves. Whilst the creatures as strong and swift, I am confident in my ability to leave this hunt alive."
 hunt.0520.ubir: "[Glossary('Ubir', 'animal_type_ubir_encyclopedia_desc')] are known to be bloodthirsty, repulsive creatures, commonly found in the [Glossary('Aironoian steppe', 'great_steppe_encyclopedia_desc')] digging through the rotting corpses of recent battles. Stories speak of the monsters sneaking into villages under the cover of night to take children back to its lair."
 hunt.0520.ugkilrrrmag: "[Glossary('Ugkilrrrmag', 'animal_type_ugkilrrrmag_encyclopedia_desc')] are a deadly foe for the unprepared. By the time a growth is noticed on one's skin, the infection is often too far gone for even amputation to save one's life."
 hunt.0520.ukhinbooum: "[Glossary('Ukhinbooum', 'animal_type_ukhinbooum_encyclopedia_desc')] are disgusting, vitrolic creatures. It is said that the creatures are dangerously venomous, and if they manage to latch their elongated snouts into your skin, it won't matter if they kill you themselves there and now, the toxins will do it for them. Our best chance for victory will be to strike with surprise on our side, and kill the creature as quick as we can."
 hunt.0520.urmahlullu: "From what I have heard of the [Glossary('Urmahlullu', 'animal_type_urmahlullu_encyclopedia_desc')], it is a creature of some intelligence. The stories of it hunting its own hunters seem somewhat exaggerated, but I cannot afford to underestimate the creature. With four clawed limbs and two more with the strength of a man, the wits of such a creature are the least of my worries."
 hunt.0520.whisperwind: "The [Glossary('whisperwind', 'animal_type_whisperwind_encyclopedia_desc')] is thought by some to have many forms, though others believe it has no form at all."
 hunt.0520.wyrm: "[Glossary('Wyrm', 'animal_type_wyrm_encyclopedia_desc')], on the rare occasion that they are sighted and the observer survives to tell the tale, are often conflated with [dragons|E]. Though scholars postulate that the two creatures are related, wyrms lack many of the defining features of their presumed cousins - they are completely incapable of flight, do not breathe fire, and most notably, are entirely legless. They are thought to possess nearly the same level of intelligence, though this is difficult to confirm due to their hostility towards the rare human they encounter."
 hunt.0520.zilant: "The [Glossary('zilant', 'animal_type_zilant_encyclopedia_desc')] is said to live a top the craggy cliffside before us, somewhere nestled amongst the rock. The nearest villages steer clear of these cliffs, and there have been sightings of a large, red winged creature taking cattle and other herd animals."
 hunt.0520.cockatrice: "The [Glossary('cockatrice', 'animal_type_cockatrice_encyclopedia_desc')], known to some as a Eagle of [aervalr|E], to others the Granite Cockerel, and to others still the Alchemical Dragon is a God-Touched beast renowned for its venom, immense ugliness, and foul stench. Most notorious of all is its gaze, piercing and deadly. The cockatrice is known to have an intrinsic relationship with the cycles of Aervalr, and can work transformations of the dead matter of [aeras|E] with but a glance. It is for this reason that [Concept('dead_magi','Earth Magi')|E] use the beast as a heraldic icon. Care should be taken, for if the moon is waxing full the monstrosity is at its most potent. It has a particular fondness for transmuting bone to stone, which has the effect of instantly killing any unfortunate enough to be subjected to its gaze."
 hunt.0500.ground_dweller:0 "There are many who would lead you to believe that the [Glossary('ground dweller', 'animal_type_ground_dweller_encyclopedia_desc')] is nothing but a ghost story meant to frighten young pupils at the [mayikrata|E], but rumors began to circulate out recently from here suggesting that just such a monster has been terrorizing the area for weeks. This might be just what we have been searching for!"
 hunt.0510.desc_monster: "\n\nThere are doubtless many beasts in the [ROOT.Char.Custom.GetCurrentLocation.Custom('GetTerrainLandPlural')] of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], and my attendants present me with several options for us to hunt."

 hunt.0500.no_monster: "While there is sadly nothing concrete on what lurks in the wilderness here, we may still be lucky enough to find a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalMale')]."
 hunt.0550.monster: "\n\n[aeras|E] has many [monsters|E] to slay, and soon it will have one less..."
 hunt.1003.stinger: "\n\nThe huntsmen warily surround the creature, which stares beadidly at me, its razor sharp stinger shining in the light."
 hunt.1003.toxins: "\n\nThe huntsmen warily surround the creature, afraid to get too close lest it manages to strike and turn their flesh to rot."

 gh_hunt.1001.t: "Slaying the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')|U]"

 ## Monster Lair hunt loc ##
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.adze: "We encounter the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] just outside of a small village, seeing it bent over the husk of a sheep. It has not noticed us yet."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.akapura: "This particular [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] has only recently awoken, its luminous head visible above the waves whilst its limbs remain inside its shell. \n\nWe have prepared a bomb for the task. The shell of the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] is tougher than stone, and its limbs are thick and scaly: the only way we could truly kill such a beast is from the inside."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.almas: "At the top of the rocky climb before us is said to be the hunting grounds of an [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] that has been attacking travelers throughout the mountain paths. The climb is cold and difficult, the wind a sharp chill against us. We hear a raspy howl echo through the rocks as we prepare to set out."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.apep_ibizan: "The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] has few weaknesses, if any. As we finally find the hideous beast devouring what seems to be yet another family of humans, we prepare our bows, and I begin to feel that coming here might have been a mistake."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.banshee: "Locating the lair of this vile [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] was a rather impressive feat of research and magical tracking in and of itself. But for all the difficulty of this step, the next is going to be far worse - not only will we have to face the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] and its powerful [magic|E], but the numerous mortal and ethereal servants it has bound to itself over the eons."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.bhramar: "With a spear in one hand and a torch in the other, I lead our party closer to the moaning swarm. It paces awkwardly around an ancient tree, the shape of a man but with wasps ripping out from its flesh and slamming back in with every beat of my heart. It looks toward my torch and stops in its paces, waiting to see if I mean it harm from only a few paces away.\n\nThe moaning only gets louder, and my chance to kill the creature begins to slip away."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.chimera: "We have followed the trail of devastated villages and huddled survivors for a few days now. It makes for an easy track to follow, an odd experience after weeks upon weeks of chasing rumors of eviscerated sheep. But now the beast has lain waste to the land around it with savage indiscrimination. We know not why the chimera has changed tactics like this, but some of my hunters whisper darkly that the monster has detected us, and is now attempting to mock us.\n\nThe very thought makes my blood run cold."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.coatl: "We've treked through the dense jungle undergrowth for hours, following a winding river upstream to a small waterfall that some of the locals claimed to be the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')]'s lair. Upon our approach, I notice what seems to be a crevice hidden behind the gushing water. If we climb the vines dangling near the fall, we could use them to swing inside. I make sure my blade won't fall from my side and ready my net, slinging it across my arm."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.cockatrice: "Our anticipation grew as we approached the beast's lair. Signs of its presence were clear in the form of petrified trees and the bones of wildlife turned to stone, still adorned with rotted scraps of skin and fur. As we approach the hollow whence it has made its home, we are struck with an overbearing stench - not of death or rot, but more reminiscent of an alchemist's rubbish heap. The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] appears to have formed a nest of petrified trees, twisted and pulled over the top to form an enveloping canopy. My hunting party looks at me with clear terror in their eyes. Though we have taken every precaution and ensured the phase of Aervalr is favorable, this fight is still bound to be a terrible one."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.cor: "Following the advice of locals who claimed the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] stalked the pitch black tunnels of a nearby cave, we set out in search. It took hours to find the cavern they spoke of, the only noticable feature being a sort of hawk-shaped rune above its mouth. With deep breaths and steady hands, we step into the darkened tunnel. Torchlight flickers across the cave walls, and I see faces and creatures dancing in the corner of my eyes. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest with every step we take deeper into this underworld, and we soon come upon a small, cramped hole, a tight and jagged crevice leading deeper. If we are to find this monster, we'll have to climb through individually, but it will not be easy to turn back from here. We must be ready."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.crocotta: "I spot a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] clan feasting together on the remains of two boars. As my party draw closer, I see that their 'teeth' are in fact just a single ridge of bone on either jaw, ripping away massive chunks of flesh at a time. We move closer to the clan steadily, making sure to keep quiet enough to not alert them too early. If we act too soon, the creatures will surround us and pounce at us with a speed and power that we cannot match."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.dire_mosquito: "As I move with my companions through the jungle, eyes watching what shafts of light shine through the thick canopy, I swat away several buzzing insects, miniature versions of the monster we seek to slay. After wandering for what seems like forever, I can hear something. A quiet droning, off in the distance. I raising a trembling hand towards the pillar of sunlight that shines down from above.\n\nAnd then, the light goes out, as the sound becomes deafening, and the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] descends from the gap in the trees. Its strange red eyes, patterned with hexagons, seem to reflect the dim sunlight. Its legs hang below it, its long bodyp supported by imperceptibly fast wings, producing an unending cascade of sound."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.dire_stag: "Though strictly plant-eating and content to ignore creatures that pose no threat, the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] are known to viciously retaliate when provoked, and their lumbering size does not slow them down one bit compared to their mundane counterpart. Many a foolish hunter has met his end impaled by the creature's antlers, not expecting it to actually strike back after their shot fails to kill it.\n\nIn front of me, I watch the beast that my party has been tracking for days. Hitting the thing anywhere but the most sensitive parts of the body will do nothing but annoy it, and put me in grave danger."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.djinn: "I wander through a canyon where several [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] are reported to dwell, and I know I'm close when I feel something pulling in the pit of my stomach. I spot something moving in a shadowy crevice, but it seems to be that the shadow itself is alive! It is the djinn's form, barely visible in the low light, and it seems to be eyeing me apprehensively."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.doyarchu: "The stillness of the marsh is broken by the sound of water splashing and as I turn to see the source, the characteristic lizard like tail of a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] slinks into the deep, its ugly head rearing out of the marsh bearing dagger like teeth."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.dreadleech: "In order to hunt the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')], a plan has been devised. I have prepared a trap for the creature, in the form of a pig tied beside a campfire, brought for this specific purpose. When the beast approaches, it will feast upon the pig, and we can emerge from the surrounding treetops to kill the beast. After hours of waiting, eyes watching the darkness, I see a shadowy mass moving beyond the firelight, and the pig begins squealing.\n\nAnd then, a massive black shape emerges into the dim glow, and I behold a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] the size of a building, moving with surprising swiftness as it slides across the ground towards the unfotunate pig..."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.false_hydra: "nA toothy head breaks through the mud beside my foot, and then another appears behind me. The false hydra slowly draws itself to the surface to feast on me, an unwelcome interloper in its hunting grounds. I must be wary, because if the creatures sings its song, I will forget my purpose. It may appear as little more than a many-headed worm, but it is a creature I dare not underestimate.\n\nI must choose to fight this creature now, or forget it forever if I dare to turn my back."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.forest_troll: "Every [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] is a ravenous creature, and it shows - completely destroyed berry groves, knocked down trees, and ravaged animal carcasses litter the area. Soon enough, we locate the lair itself — a cave, naturally — and prepare to enter..."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.gajara: "All thoughts of rumours fade from my party's minds when we first lay eyes upon this particular [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')]. It sits on the stump of a tree, idly yet ferociously ripping apart its latest victim. As the child in its tusked maws is devoured, I realise that it will not be long until it sees me.\n\nI have my doubts that such a creature could be killed now that I can see it in the flesh, but I can only try."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.gargoyle: "One never fights a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] alone, for they are creatures of a social temperament. Their strength, speed and durability is a frightening combination of traits and a single mistake can leave a would-be slayer dead as quick as lightning. Success will depend on a mix of caution, skill and a dash of luck."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.gaunt: "As my hunting party and I approach the steep crag where the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] are residing, I quietly motion for a few members of the party to bring tinder for the fire. In a few minutes, a roaring conflagration has filled the sky with smoke. The caves too have been smoked out, as a number of the creatures come shrieking out into the sky.\n\nMost of the hunting party remains silent, awaiting the first shot."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.giant: "Though it has taken us days to reach the deep woodland where the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] can be found, once their trail is picked up, it is trivial to follow. Not only are they huge, but they almost invariably live in small groups and travel together, making the path of their movements all the more apparent. We've been tracking this particular group for some time, and waiting for one of their kind to separate from the rest in search of food - attacking all of them at once would be a foolish endeavor. As soon as I spot the opportunity, I begin my approach."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.giant_bee: "Several [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] fly idly past us, deeper into the forest, and others soon follow.We  have prepared several bundles of tinder and leaves, if we're right, we'll be able to light the bundle aflame and smother the remaining bees with smoke, leaving them docile and much easier to handle.\n\nThere is of course the possibility we wake them first, agitating the queen before we make it even a foot inside. We'll need to move quietly with care if we hope to succeed here."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.giant_spider: "The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] is nowehere to be seen, but it is most certainly in the vicinity - these monsters are not ones to roam, and subsist purely on whatever unlucky creatures wander into their lair. Of course, I have no intentions of actually searching for the arachnid myself. Disturbing the web is certainly going to attract the attention of the thing."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.great_rahksasa: "When we finally spotted the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] through the foliage, it had begun ravaging the corpses of two unlucky travelers. We could hear their screams in the distance as we tracked, though there was no chance we could help.\n\nWith the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] preoccupied, we skulk closer through the underbrush, careful to make as little sound as possible. There is no room for error when hunting these creatures, and we must be decisive and cunning if we hope to survive. The beast knocks down a tree that it had smashed against in an attempt to push the corpse deeper into its gullet, and now struggles to force its meal down."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.griffon: "We left our mounts a good distance away, safely under the guard of some of my companions both to protect them from mortal thieves as well as the threat of the airborne hunter which we seek. As we approach the lair of the [Glossary('griffon', 'animal_type_griffon_encyclopedia_desc')], we made sure to spread out, keeping one another within our sight and looking up to the skies in case of ambush.\n\nMy heart beats faster and my face is set with grim determination, eyes darting from point to point. After what feels like an eternity we finally mount the summit, finding the nest of the beast, but seeing no trace of it. We stand, unsure of how to process, until we are shaken by a piercing cry from above our heads. Wheeling around, we can see the monster preparing to dive with death in its eyes."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.hieracosphinx: "nAs we reach the crest of a hill, a surprisingly small nest greets us. The remains of the local wildlife are strewn between three hatchlings, blood still on their beaks. Their mother has not left them long, of that I am sure. The eyasses begin to squeak at us, crawling closer on their clawed paws. Turning to see what garnered their attention, I see their mother returning to the nest.\n\nI must make my move quickly, or else be caught in the creature's grasp."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.karkadann: "Just beyond the hillcrest that we've hidden behind, our quarry grazes in the low shrubbery. The other animals nearby have stayed clear of the monstrous [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')], a lonely [activity.Custom('GetAnimalMale')] who has been in search of a mate. The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] is very similar in to its smaller cousin, the [Glossary('rhinoceros','animal_type_rhinoceros_encyclopedia_desc')], but far more treacherous to hunt. Its massive horn seems more like a sharpened blade, cut to a fine point at its tip. The sheer size of the beast seems insurmountable, its lean, muscular build easily dwarfing us.  As the beast trudges through a narrow creek bed, it pays no mind to the world around it. If we hope to win, we must act with cunning, and a hint of surprise."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.kursha: "nMy party have tracked a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] bold enough to remain feasting upon its latest carcass, even when there is no sign of its pack. Whilst it is consumed by its meal, there is no doubt in my mind that it will hear me if I step even a foot closer.\n\nIt raises its snout as my scent begins to drift across the mountain face."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.spriggan: "We tread lightly through the dense woods, aware that the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] is now nearby. Luckily, we manage to notice it just in time - a sprawling mass of wood and leaves gently oozing sap, its long 'limbs' almost indistinguishable from the surrounding flora.\n\nGently, I remove the pot of liquid fire stowed away in my backpack, and ready to throw it at my quarry."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.living_blizzard: "As we finally finish our grueling climb up a cliff face, we come upon the snowy slope on which we first noticed the persistent snowstorm that seemed to move with too much purpose. Our suspicions are confirmed as the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] begins to approach, no doubt thinking of us as its next plaything. I can only hope that the esoteric spells, incantations and Sarradonian tarshaf glass we brought along will be enough to contain, or at least destroy the thing. On terrain such as this, retreat is likely to prove impossible."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.lymrill: "Just before us, sipping from a shallow bend amidst the flowing cascades as several salmon carcasses rot nearby, the mystical [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] seems to almost shimmer in the midday sun. While some of us may have doubted that this creature truly had metal quills, the way light shines off of its body, like how it would against our blades, leaves no doubt in our minds."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.manticore: "We have trekked for leagues on end, following a dodgy dirt path deep into a long-deserted valley. The tension mounts the further we roam into the valley, and eventually, we see it: the nest of the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')], perched at the crest of the furthermost hill. I draw my bow, ready my sword, and advance."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.myrmeke: "The jungle moves around me, trees swaying with an unnatural fervour. The buzz of a thousand insects envelops my party, but we press on further to find our prize: a myrmeke swarm. It is said that they resemble the bodies of men in the shadow of the canopy, a trick that will not fool me. I am sure of my abilities to hunt the swarm.\n\nThe shape of a man hugs a tree not too far to our south, and I call a halt to our movement."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.naga: "The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] dances about at the rear of the cave in its skinsuit, a young woman's visage hung abnormally over its pale green scales. It shifts about in a sort of ritual before my eyes, becoming one with its form. As I watch it grow closer to truly wearing another thing's skin, I realise that my window to catch it unaware has begun to dwindle. If I am to kill this monster, then I must act quickly."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.owlbear: "Our prey stands some distance from us, looking into the river water at its feet as it tries to catch the fish swimming by. My companions and I have readied our bows, spears, and torches in hopes to catch the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] off guard—its ferocious claws and powerful beak are well known for their power, but an aversion to fire may be our best chance at taking the beast down.\n\nThe [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] looks up for a moment, almost as if noticing our presence, before returning to its meal as it catches a salmon flowing by."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.roaring_lizard: "The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] my party have been following travels together in a small, tightly knit group. Whilst I am unsure how many there are, it is not enough to make our endeavor hopeless.\n\nThe largest of the adults slinks deeper into the jungle. We follow from afar, careful not to draw too close to the creature whilst its pack are still close. Despite my careful actions, however, the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] has turned, and stares down toward where I am standing.\n\nThe old legends say that it will not see me if I remain still, but I cannot be sure.."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.rock_giant: "Wandering through the desolate mountain paths, it was only a matter of time until we heard the distinct sound of rumbling and a low yet agonizing groan. With me, I have a specially crafted Salisian war-hammer - a sword or bow wouldn't be able to break the rocks - and I grip it tight. This fight will not be easy..."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.running_raptor: "As we near a cave, the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] emerges. Its feathered arms are coated with blood, and its glistening green eyes flick around the jungle carefully. I have moved behind a tree, but there is no guarantee of safety; the raptor has begun to stalk toward my party. If it has gotten our scent, then my party might well be doomed.\n\nWe will need to fight or flee soon if we are to survive."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.shade: "We have ample reason to believe that the ruins in front of us is host to a group of [activity.Custom('GetAnimalGroup')]. The darkness lying beyond the entrance is so pitch black that one feels it might just devour any who enter."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.spirit: "We have tracked rumors and [Concept('magic','Magical')|E] traces of this [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] to a ruin completely reclaimed by nature. Of course, most haunts are not active during daytime, so we have some time to prepare for the encounter until the Sun sets."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.tarasque: "We finally encounter the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] as it ransacks a farming community, dealing terrible damage to the livestock and leaving the farmers helpless.\n\nThe beast doesn't seem to have noticed our approach."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.twin_serpent: "The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] is a solitary creature, and used to hunting isolated prey. Our hope is that my party and I can overwhelm the creature's abilities all at once, distributing the tail and heads between us. Even so, the sight of the gargantuan snake before us makes my knees weak.\n\nI have to ensure that I'm ready to fight such a creature, else my death will be inevitable."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.ubir: "A few miles south of the last battlefield we searched, one of my companion's discovered a shoddy, nearly crumbled cave entrance, hidden by the tall grass. The cave's mouth seems dug out from the earth, almost a straight drop down beneath its surface. The putrid air escaping from beneath the dirt makes us  gag the closer we come to the cave.\n\nIf we hope to find this [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')], this will be our best chance, but I cannot say I like the odds of fighting such a creature in its lair."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.ugkilrrrmag: "My party spot what appears to be a decaying corpse stumbling about in a nearby ravine, a tangled mess of eyes emerging from all parts of its red, fleshy body. It is undoubtedly an [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] colony crawling toward whatever it can find to be its next host. I follow its slow movement from behind, gradually creeping closer and closer to where I will make the first strike."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.ukhinbooum: "From where we've hidden ourselves in the rocks, just above the coastline, three of the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] suckle on the juices of a corpse, while wrapping it in webbing excreted from their tail end. Their dark, outer carapaces shimmer under the bright sun, wet from the rising tide. Each of the creature's six legs scamper through the the sand, shifting and jumping with a frenzied hunger. Not far along the coast, the opening of a massive cave yawns, most likely their nest. Our best chance for victory will be to strike with surprise on our side, and kill the creature as quick as we can."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.urmahlullu: "My party find an [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] raging across the plains with no prey in sight. It turns on its clawed legs multiple times, charging at nothingness. As we get closer, I see a primitive spear held in its hand made from a broken branch, and it seems to turn toward me.\n\nWhether it has spotted us is unclear, but we must act decisively."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.whisperwind: "I feel a gust of air emerge from a chasm and alert my party. Crawling through the corridors as discreetly as we can, we wait for another sign. Our torches flicker in the dark corridor, and soon we are plunged into darkness. I am sure that the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] is toying with us, thinking that we cannot escape it so deep into the [mayikrata|E]'s hidden alcoves.\n\nIf I am to escape or fight the creature, then I will need to ready myself soon."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.wyrm: "Naturally reclusive, the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] have survived in the most isolated and remote pockets of the Etepezean highland, inhabiting secluded, cavernous lairs and only occasionally emerging to feast upon local wildlife, stray cattle, or perhaps even the unlucky peasant. They generally seem to avoid drawing attention to themselves, so finding the abode of one was a challenge indeed.\n\nHowever, we have succeeded in doing so, and in front of me lies the entrance to a large, expansive cavern that I know for a fact is the lair of a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')].\n\nThis will not be an easy fight."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.zilant: "We climb high into a solitary cliffline, looking for the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] and its lair. The rocky top sides bend into the sky like curled fingers, guarding what's hidden amongst the stone.\n\nWith every step, I can hear the dirt and pebble crunch underfoot. It is quiet in the rocks. We climb higher, and over my shoulder I can see the vast steppe beyond the cliffs. When I turn back to the rocks, a new sound trickles into my ear; snoring. While I cannot help but feel a rush at the thought of killing such a grand beast as a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')], we must be cautious and cunning if we hope to not only survive, but also emerge victorious."
 gh_hunt.1001.desc.ground_dweller: "We finally track this mysterious beast, the '[activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')]' as the villagers called it, after following the mess of refuse left by a caravan it had attacked on the road. The bits of flesh and devastated limbs lead us to a small ravine, at the bottom of which a hole seems to have been dug in the bottom.\n\nSliding down, I hear and smell the beast before I see it. The sounds of relentless panting and growling and claws against dirt and stone, and the smell of unwashed flesh and blood and filth.One of the men takes my spear and hands me a hand-axe, and nodding, I duck down to take our first step into the pit."
 gh_hunt.1001.a: "Together, as one!"

 gh_hunt.1003.desc: "After feeling like we would never find it, we finally uncovered the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] and its lair. Our search has not been in vain!\n\n"

 gh_hunt.1003.generic: "We can see the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] otherwise occupied in its hidden nest, unaware of our presence thus far. Yet with a twitch, we freeze, as it lets out a loud [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')].\n\nIt's sure to notice our presence soon if we do not act fast."

 gh_hunt.1003.humanoid: "With us finally uncoovering the monster, the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')]'s grotesque features twist into a snarl. Its massive hands grip a crude weapon, and its eyes lock onto us with predatory intent. The ground shakes with each step forward, before it lets out a guttural [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')] that echoes around us."

 gh_hunt.1003.arthropod: "A low hum now fills the air as the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] descends from its nest, glinting in the dim light. It hovers in the air before us, ready to strike at our moment of weakness."

 gh_hunt.1003.beast: "The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] lets out a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')] that reverberates through the [host.GetCurrentLocation.Custom('GetTerrainType')], its [activity.Custom('GetAnimalFeature')] bristling as it steps forward. I can see its muscles tense as its eyes, filled with a primal fury, prepare to charge.\n\nThe air grows heavy."

 gh_hunt.1003.spirit: "As we climb and crawl to get further through this abandoned place, a chill runs down my spine as the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalAdjective')] [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] materializes, its form flickering like a dying flame. The feeling of eyes fixating on me creeps onto my spine, and a whisper, cold and alien, echoes between us."

 gh_hunt.1003.rock_giant: "As we climb through the rocky[host.GetCurrentLocation.Custom('GetTerrainType')], the ground began to crack and split from the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] trudging nearby. It's body spits and shatters like a swirling mass of molten rock.\n\nThe air begins to simmer the closer it gets to us, we'll need to use all our strength if we are to crack the monster's core."

 gh_hunt.1003.flying: "A shadow passes overhead, and I look up just in time to see the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] circling, its wings blotting out the sun. A piercing cry echoes through the air as it prepares to dive!"

 gh_hunt.1003.snake: "The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')]  glisten as it coils, its forked tongue flicking out to taste the air. The sound of its hiss fills the air, a low, menacing warning that sends a shiver down my spine.\n\nWe will need to act fast."

 gh_hunt.1003.worm: "The ground trembled beneath our feet, and we barely had time to leap aside as the massive [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] burst from the earth. Its gaping maw, lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth, snapped shut inches from where I stood.\n\n Now, this [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] lets out a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')], writhing around us as it prepares to strike again."

 gh_hunt.1003.swamp: "We traveled delicately deeper into the marsh until we stumbled onto its trail. water churns violently as the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] surfaces, its slick, glistening skin reflecting in the light. Its eyes, cold and unfeeling, lock onto us as it lets out a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')]. The air fills with the stench of brine and decay as it drags itself closer, leaving little time to respond."

 gh_hunt.1003.gross_insect: "The air grows thick with the stench of decay as the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] emerges from the shadows, its bloated, pulsating body glistening with a sickly sheen. The monster's elongated limbs twitch unnaturally, and its jagged mandibles drip with a viscous, black fluid. The creature’s multifaceted eyes reflect a cold hunger, [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSoundParticiple')] as its legs twitch."

 gh_hunt.1003.giant_reptile: "The [host.GetCurrentLocation.Custom('GetTerrainType')] falls eerily silent as we step forward, the only sound the rustle of leaves underfoot. A low, rumbling [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')] reverberates through the trees, and we freeze. From the dense foliage, the massive head of a [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] turns to face us, its scales glistening with moisture from the humid air. The monster's slit-pupiled eyes lock with mine, and its forked tongue flicks out, tasting the air. Its body shifts, revealing its immense size as it coils around a tree, tail dragging through the underbrush with the sound of tearing fabric."

 gh_hunt.1003.elemental: "The air grows heavy, and a faint shimmer distorts the space before me. A gust of wind swirls unnaturally, coalescing into a vague shape made of swirling mist and crackling energy. Its form flickers, neither fully solid nor entirely ethereal, and a low hum resonates in my ears as it drifts closer, its glowing eyes piercing through the haze."

 gh_hunt.1003.draconic: "A deep, rumbling [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')] echoes through the cavern, and I freeze as the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] emerges from the shadows. Its scales glisten [activity.Custom('GetAnimalColor')], and its massive wings unfurl with a sound like tearing fabric. The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')]  locks onto us, and its lips curl back to reveal rows of dagger-like teeth. The air grows thick with the scent of brimstone as it inhales, preparing to unleash its fiery breath."

 gh_hunt.1003.lymrill: "The underbrush rustles as the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] steps into view, its metallic fur glinting in the dappled sunlight. Its quills bristle, each one sharp enough to pierce stone, and its beady eyes lock onto me with a calculating gaze. The [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] clicks its claws against the ground as it circles, its movements deliberate and unnervingly precise, like a predator sizing up its prey."

 gh_hunt.1003.kursha: "A high-pitched [activity.Custom('GetAnimalSound')] pierces the air, and I turn just in time to see the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')] swoop down from the rocks above us. Its leathery wings beat furiously, sending gusts of wind that whip through the canyon. Its gleam like polished steel. It hovers for a moment, its glowing eyes fixed on us."

 gh_hunt.1003.spriggan: "The forest grows thicker as we venture, with trees twisting into knots around us. A low, creaking groan echoes through the woods. Its from here that we see it.\n\n A [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')].\n\nIts form tilts slowly, writhing outward from the dirt. The air grows heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay as it moves with a deliberate and unnerving silence."

 gh_hunt.1003.ground_dweller: "One of my men takes my spear and hands me a hand-axe, and nodding, I duck down and step into the hole. So small is it that I am forced to duck to make way, forcing myself forward against the smell. Behind me, a torch is rolled in, illuminating the space immediately.\n\nThe beast is revealed with this, hunched over with skin so pale that I can see the rushing veins beneath. It is covered in tumors and its skin is flaking and peeling, but as it turns around and howls at me I am surprised to see a...\n\na humanoid face.\n\nI would have mistaken it for a plague-ridden man had it not been for the twisted limbs, the glowing eyes, or the strange, pointed ears on both sides of its head."
