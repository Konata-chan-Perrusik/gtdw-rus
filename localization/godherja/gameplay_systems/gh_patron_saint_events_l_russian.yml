 patron_saint_event.0201.desc:3 "When working in emulation of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], one must at some point take action beyond belief and prayer. Of course, given my day to day duties as an administrator of my realm I can hardly afford to take on the work of a physician full time, so I must direct my endeavors narrowly. Dedicating my efforts as a healer to the sick and wounded in my realm is always the obvious and effective option. Alternatively I could spend my time spreading teachings and medical knowledge of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName] to the masses. Of course, I could always just build another hospital."
 patron_saint_event.0201.a:0 "To personally heal the sick is the truest way to serve [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName]."
 patron_saint_event.0201.b:0 "Spreading the medical knowledge of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName] will let the people heal themselves."

 patron_saint_event.0210.desc:3 "Turning a stable into a makeshift clinic, I set to work directing my servants to go door to door in the local area, bringing out the sick and the wounded, and drag the first of the poor fellows up onto the surgery table. Idly stropping my surgical knife, I approach to begin my heroic and noble work.\n\n The next few days do not go well, and many of those who can walk choose to leave before I can take my turn with them. Honestly I have to admit to myself, it's not my best work. Perhaps a physician's life is not for me?"
 patron_saint_event.0210.a:0 "We tried. It's all we can do."

 patron_saint_event.0211.desc:3 "Turning an outbuilding into a makeshift clinic, I set to to work directing my servants to bring in the local sick and wounded. The next few days fly by in a blur of blood, viscera and sutures. It's hard and confusing work, with each new patient and set of symptoms a novel mystery and ordeal. I wonder to myself if I'm cut out for this life.\n\nSoon I find myself looking at an empty clinic, the air thick with the smell of blood and illness, the scrubbed floors sticky with viscera and discarded bandages. No doctor can save everyone, but I can take solace in knowing that at least a few lives were spared by my actions here. Frankly, it's a relief to finally go back to court and get out of this place."

The next few days fly by in a blur of blood, viscera and sutures. Soon my excitement at each new patient turns into a jaded detachment, each bleeding gash, buboe, or set of symptoms falling into a set template.\n\nSoon I find myself looking at an empty clinic, the air thick with the cloying smell of herbs and dried blood, weary from many sleepless nights of work. While we had to send some whose fates were sealed home with heavy sedative in hopes of alleviating the suffering of their last days, overall I feel a blooming sense of pride at the lives I was able to save."

 patron_saint_event.0220.desc:3 "Setting out on foot with a few servants, I begin my tour of the nearby villages. While it's just a short jaunt through the local countryside I'm quite hopeful that we should be able to impress upon the unwashed masses the virtues of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName], or at least satisfyingly browbeat them for their ignorance.\n\nSkeptical and argumentative crowds meet us in every village hall, and at several instances I have to shout and demand their attention over the jeers and insults. Though I'm not sure how much actually got through to them, I at least have the satisfaction of knowing that when their wounds swell with infection and their children are born wrong because they didn't listen to my preaching it'll be nobody's fault but their own!"

While it's just a short jaunt through the local countryside I'm quite hopeful that we should be able to impress upon the local bumpkins the importance of the virtues of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName].\n\nWe do good work out there. I lecture the locals of the warnings signs of disease, and demonstrate how to properly dispose of human night soil. To a few who seem particularly gifted I try and explain how to clean and treat wounds. Annoyingly, a few of these discussions turn into heated arguments, with Thysian learning pitted against the dogmatic superstitions of the peasantry. Nevertheless, as we head home at the end of the day, I think I managed to change a few minds."
 patron_saint_event.0221.a:0 "Well, small steps at first I suppose."

While it's just a short jaunt through the local countryside I'm quite hopeful that we should be able to impress upon the local peasantry the importance of the virtues of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName].\n\nTo the midwives I teach the basics of obstetrics. To the village elders I teach the early signs of an approaching plague. To everyone I teach how to set a broken limb, and how to properly wash and bind a wound, as well as basic hygienic practices for healthy living. Soon I am on my way back home, tired but satisfied with the results of a day spent preaching. "

 patron_saint_event.0231.desc:3 "Press ganging any doctor or scholar I can find in the vicinity, I set the local carpenters and masons to work on constructing my hospital.

 patron_saint_event.0232.desc:3 "Having rounded up and hired every doctor, midwife, and herbalist in the area, I set the local carpenters and masons to work on constructing my hospital. Architecturally it's not particularly complicated, a set of storerooms centered around a central chamber with beds and an ad hoc administrative apparatus. We have time for nothing but that which is necessary for the careful and holy arts of healing."
 patron_saint_event.0232.a:0 "A simple, clean hospital."
