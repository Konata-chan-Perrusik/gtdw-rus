The leader of those who accepted this oath was named Irmi, and so would his tribe be called the People of Irmi, or Irmionoth.\n\nSeeking to uphold this contract, they began training, becoming ever more skilled at the arts of war. When the tribe was wronged, they would descend upon their enemy with a fury unmatched, and avenge every perceived slight. Internally, they held to a simple code, that everything must be proportional. If one were to be caught thieving, they would be required to return something of equal value in addition to the stolen goods. A feud would require the rivals to battle to the death, and so they were only invoked at harsh transgressions. With their entry into [aversaria|E], they have come to finally make the Empire pay its due.#"
 
 iseni_desc:89 "#size:15    The Iseñi are a people native to the southern isles of Aironoi, most numerous across the mercantile crossroads that pass through the straits separating Opakhasia and Aironoi.

Even the necessities for a mercantile operation, such as ships and guards, are emblazoned with noble regalia, steeped in symbolism to elevate their owner's prestige. Iseñi nobility are traditionally loathe to deal in "petty" goods like iron, grain, and cloth; a merchant-noble's prized fleet is suited to carry nothing less than silks, gems, tapestries, artwork, and any other imaginable luxury.\n\nFollowing the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] conquest of their home, the Iseñi were devastated, the majority forced by either state or circumstance to flee, most lost to the dangerous fringes of the Redlands.

Each Isle is known to meticulously track its local history and those deemed to be local heroes, events as small as the building of a new barn often leading to widespread festivities and marking in historical record.

Imperial authorities learnt of the atrocities and swiftly ended the practice worried that the loss in population may disrupt the Malcois economy.

As their economy is almost entirely based around trade, those with the ability to claw their way to the top are able to regularly break with social convention. The Redlanders also carry a series of superstitions, fearing the canyons from which it is said that none can return.#"

Though originally kin of the Konijkmener, they have become more [Concept('marchers','Chevalien')|E] over the centuries, integrating aspects of both into a unique blend. They place a strong emphasis on the water, with fishing becoming a replacement for farming in many settlements, and trade along the water being their main form of interaction with the world outside of their swamps. The construction of canals in the region was welcomed by the Rivarisians, who would rapidly integrate into the trade along them, filling roles from captains to dockworkers.\n\nDue to their position between realms, the Rivarisians are a melting pot of Konijkmener and Chevalien traditions, language, and beliefs. Their language is famously indecipherable, integrating a variety of stolen phrases and words into a nonsensical grammatical structure. To the Chevaliens, the Rivarisians are more Konijkmener than Chevalien, and looked down upon heavily, while few among the Konijkmener care how some sailors to the north speak. To most Rivarisians, however, this does not matter, for most care for little else than the boat beneath their feet and the oar in their hands.#"

The Yonata, being farmers, are tied to the seasons, and no matter the time of year their stucco villages are filled with the sounds of the Sitar and Tabla drums as the Yonata herald the coming of the harvest.\n\nWhile commonly known as a quaint folk, their position as the breadbasket of the Chordan peoples means Yonatan landowners hold much sway over the politics of Taleshtadendar. They live in some of the most fertile land in all of Kashirya, and before the rise of Valapuiwan, Yonatan kings held dominion over much of the Darmirat plain.#" 
 
 yylaxxaz_desc:89 "#size:15    The Yylaxxaz have historically been simple shepherds living off the Amaghean coast. Tribes roam the hills, following wherever the green grass grows. The tribe is centered around their flock, the sheep having as much say in their journey as the shepherds. The Yylaxxaz language is completely undecipherable to any foreigners. Dialects can vary greatly between individuals, with completely different grammar structures and pronunciations. Strangely, sparse records from decades ago have made no note of any unique languages, simply noting them as Amaghean shepherds.\n\nAs a result, most of Amaghea regards them as a simple and backwater people who spout nonsense words to each other. However, the Yylaxxaz are a philosophically minded people, with tribal elders often meeting to discuss the path that the world has taken, smoking chort and talking long into the night.#"
 
 zabari_desc:89 "#size:15    The Zabari of the eastern peninsulas of Kashirya are a nation of free-spirited craftsmen and wily merchants in the eyes of most foreign observers, but most ignore their true skill — the ability to drain the fetid wetlands of their homelands. Whilst once under the spiritual dogmatism of the Neshalar, the slow divergence of the north coast from their Surins in the 6th century allowed the tradition of pristine wetlands to be broken. Now, after centuries of learning their craft, the Zabari are unafraid of expanding their new cities at all costs.\n\nZabari cities are also famous for their diverse array of weaponry, with every style of sword or club imaginable, as well as various projectile weapons, sold in their vast markets. The walls are short and thick, and the air, whilst foul-smelling, is said to be filled with magical energy by the locals. Even the most persistent creatures of the Kashiryan wetlands are said to fear the Zabari's relentless expansionism.#"

 zakhirun_desc:89 "#size:15    When the [sabar_lambay_raad|E] brought night unending to Haryaadad, not all of its people sought the sun. Bound by chains of power, riches, or love, the Zakhirun chose to dwell within the dark city, ever prowling its dim expanse. Over time, these 'Shadow-Dwellers' have adapted to their bleak home, and are said to bear a monstrous visage that thrives in the absence of light."
 
 zelkavani_desc:89 "#size:15    The Zelkavani are [Concept('zelkavani_glassmaking','proficient glassmakers')|E], native to the shores of the aptly named Sea of Glass. Famed across Aironoi and beyond as masterful artisans and industrious craftspeople, the Zelkavani themselves prefer to adorn only minimal luxuries—usually those received as gifts or items of sentimental value. Like many other Kherkeloi settlements and owing to the constant threat of fires from extensive glassworks, Zelkavani cities are neatly structured into spacious districts interspersed with large, stele-marked plazas, avoiding the squalor typically associated with dense urban centers."
 
 zharran_desc:89 "#size:15    Самая маленькая из культуры Даятеми, Жарраны, как известно, управляется сообществом. Расположенные на юге равнин, граничащих с Каширским морем, люди являются опытными рыбаками и являются основными поставщиками водного мяса и товаров в регионе. Это также делает их очень искусными военнослужащими и командирами, и они высоко ценятся государством Кашти для защиты своей торговли. Еще одним навыком, которым они обладают и который высоко ценится, является искусное садоводство, многие из которых нанимаются в королевские дворы в качестве придворных садовников и строят роскошные королевские сады, которым завидуют многие.\n\nИз-за скудного количества людей, придерживающихся этой жизни, они предпочитают практиковать пацифистские традиции, чем вести войну, которая может привести к разрушению их образа жизни, в обмен на бессмысленную славу.#"
 
 zoldagn_desc:89 "#size:15    Обитающие глубоко в обрывистых северных горах, зольдагны — это затворническое племя, с которым редко кто сталкивается. Их старейшины часто отправляются в духовные путешествия, чтобы достичь просветления — умудренные опытом старые отшельники являются обычным явлением в рассказах и сагах севера. золдагны пользуются большим уважением за свою мудрость среди других горных кланов, и могущественных вождей часто можно увидеть рядом с советником зольдагнами.#"

 #chevalies_desc:89 "#size:15    С течением времени различные культуры [chevalie|E] слились воедино, образовав единое целое. Вояжены, возможно, оказали наибольшее влияние на это объединение, и их положение в качестве правителей Марок оставило свой след. Это не означает, что другие культуры просто были заменены. Вместо этого они слились, объединив аспекты своих собственных индивидуальных традиций, создав космополитическую суперкультуру, охватывающую королевство. В ней можно найти остатки почти каждого обычая, когда-то практиковавшегося в регионе.\n\nЧто именно определяет культуру шевалье, является широко обсуждаемым вопросом, поскольку люди многих культур, составляющих ее, утверждают, что она определяется их конкретными традициями. Насколько можно согласиться, нет ни одной индивидуальной характеристики, которая выделялась бы. То, что делает ее уникальной, — это смешение практик, их сочетание, образующее нечто совершенно новое. Ремесленники Салисианцев обрели карсавизианскую решимость, Вояжены зажгли пламя в Трустионцах, а Ривазианцы вплели свой язык в общий язык. Наследие Шевигадов восстановлено, и люди Марок снова едины, как по факту, так и по названию.#"
