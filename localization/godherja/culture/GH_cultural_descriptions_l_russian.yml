To Lonely Lighters, they were infamous and hated raiders known for their constant harassment from the coasts even while the Liches plunged ever deeper into the north.

 adani_desc:89 "#size:15    The lands of the Adani consist of dry hills, where only the hardiest of communities grow to a considerable size without the threat of starvation. Thus, they relied upon scholar-kings to lead them through the cold and dry winters when [magic|E] was the only solution to famine and drought. Such reliance upon the most learned has solidified the place of ancient and tested knowledge amongst the Adani, and a xenophobic attitude to their neighbours who they believe wish to rob them of their sacred secrets, especially following the [dharya_varha|E].\n\nThe most peculiar tradition of the Adani to foreign observers is the [Glossary( 'Doynateka Saryatti', 'GH_DOYNATEKA_SARYATTI_GLOSS' )], and those who sponsor the elephant that reaches the bottom first are said to be saved from drought for ten cycles of [aervalr|E].

 adnanari_desc:89 "#size:15    The Adnanari are the people of the east [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] kingdoms of Kekhenemhat. Though widely thought to descend from ancient nomadic tribes who completely abandoned their lifestyles and settled down in the Khenem river valley and the nearby coasts over a thousand years ago, their modern connection with an ancient nomadic past can barely be detected and may be more legend than fact.\n\nControlling the critical juncture at which the Gonan road meets the north Sarradonian coast, they have developed a strong commercial spirit, and have managed to offset the relative infertility of the Khenem river valley with income and imports from their mercantile endeavors. Woe betide those who think this makes them soft, as constant warfare with raiders from the desert interior has honed their fighting spirit for generations. The elaborate and somewhat baroquely vengeful interpretation taken towards personal honor by the Adnanari is famous and has both helped and hindered them in equal measure throughout history. While many great Adnanari empire building endeavors have collapsed to internecine conflict, so too have many unsuspecting conquerors also found themselves fatally unprepared for the deadly cycles of revenge their conquests have brought down upon their own heads.\n\nSuch things should be expected to come from maintaining honor, say the Adnanari.#"

 adrakamp_desc:89 "#size:15    The northern lowlands were home to some of the most metropolitan Sjalvolki societies, the Adrakamp key among them. Merchants from across all clans flocked to their settlements in hopes of selling their wares, anything a tribesman might need could be found in an Adrakamp market. This prosperity was ironically born from their homeland's poor fertility and mountainous terrain causing them to trade in order to sustain their population. The driving necessity to keep the wealth flowing taught the Adrakamp chieftains the subtle art of diplomacy to avoid the more bloody aspects of Sjalvolki clan politics. Instead of fighting for territory, the Adrakamp were called to mediate disputes between rival tribes, and Adrakamp towns were neutral ground for the purposes of commerce and diplomacy, with blood feuds and vendettas becoming legally null the moment a clansman crossed into their territory. This is not to say these mercantile clans were craven, when attacked the Adrakamp would defend themselves as would be expected of any other Sjalvolki.\n\nHowever, the Adrakamp could not defend themselves from all threats.

Infamous for their arrogance, but famed for the sternness of their people, Aelarvisians were masters of war who founded the first Imperial armies that could truly be called legions, in contrast to the disorganized levies that preceded them. As a whole, they are renowned for aspiring to establish order through subjugation, and accordingly there have been many notable conquerors of Aelarvisian extract over the ages.\n\nBoth the nobility of the Aelarvisians and exceptional soldiers were known to eschew the riding of traditional mounts such as horses in favor of the legendary and terrible [dragons|E]. This earned them the moniker of 'Dragonriders'.

Aeviaxian culture is one that values wealth and trade, with merchants being considered one of the foremost groups in society, second only to the nobility. They are moreover known for prizing communal bonds, aiding one another when in need. They are inclined towards establishing enclaves in settlements that lie on upon their trade routes, developing thriving communities in far off lands. While not unwilling to wage war when necessary, they are averse to it, as wars harm the operation of the trade routes vital to the Aeviaxian merchant class. Instead, the Aeviaxians are known for utilizing diplomacy and bribery to prevent what they see as wasteful conflicts.\n\nEventually, the Aeviaxians were integrated into [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] culture as a result of the Aautokrata's campaign to merge the cultures within it, forming a singular imperial culture.#"

Due to this, they are prized mercenaries and are often sought after by faraway lords, sometimes even made into the royal guard of a particularly wealthy realm.\n\nHowever, as the wheel of time has turned, their military codices have slowly become less and less adhered to, and their own excursions beyond the great river have drastically diminished in frequency.

 alewui_kemsari_desc:89 "#size:15    Descended from Kemsari colonists who ventured north, the Northern Kemsari form the youngest of the Kemsari cultures. Seeking arable land well away from the increasingly centralized realm based in Dederak, the Alewui founded numerous cities along where the Valora river would eventually be diverted. It was here that the Alewui would come into contact with the aboriginal Zarasadari–the result of which would lead to the latter's  enslavement and subjugation by Kemsar. Along the river the Alewui formed numerous communities that were generally self-governing and received minimal oversight from the imperial government in Dederak.\n\nThe sudden destruction of the Kemsari empire however, followed by the ascent of the Amsari Hiklahn in the north, has put the Alewui Kemsari in a precarious position. Situated in the crossfire of the Ran Kemsari raiders and the Thysae armies, they occupy some of the last fertile land in Kemsar. With five continuous centuries of warfare purging any remnants of culture or historical memory, all that is left of the Alewui Kemsari are the ruins of their once great cities, which they can only gaze upon in morbid fascination.#"

 aljibal_kemsari_desc:89 "#size:15    Isolated in the mountains of central and western Kemsar, the Aljibal Kemsari were the group least impacted by the imperial collapse, with entire communities unaware about the evaporation of the central government until weeks later. Life for the Ajibal revolved around the mines in their mountains, from which nearly all wealth in the region was derived. Families would feature generations of miners with little opportunity available as the Ajibal was under the complete cultural and political superiority of the Ran Kemsari, the mountains having no ruling elite of their own. As almost all worked in salt, coal, or iron mines, life expectancy was incredibly low–if one reached forty they were considered old. The only way to escape this life was to seek service in the Kemsari armies and consequently a hardy, spartan culture formed, with a great deal of resentment towards the upper classes.\n\nThe collapse of Kemsar ended any relevance for mining in the region, but ultimately affected little other change. Their culture has always been insular and clannish, centered around family traditions and the Aljibal easily adapted to a tribal lifestyle, eager to range out of their mountains and exact retribution upon the previously dominant lowlands. What little order that remained in Kemsar immediately collapsed and the region was thrust into the anarchy that envelops it to today.#"

 almajun_kemsari_desc:89 "#size:15    Though the north would come to be known as the heart of the Kemsari Empire in its later years, it was southern Kemsar where imperial power and culture were concentrated for the first thousand or so years of its existence.

Due to their position deeper in the desert, the Almajun were hit perhaps the hardest of all the Kemsari groups, and their relative isolation from the rest of the world has bred an intensely warlike, xenophobic set of customs where foreigners are treated almost as mythological monsters and agents of evil rather than mere mortals. To say that they have almost completely abandoned the trappings of their once fine culture would be an understatement.#"

 amaghean_desc:89 "#size:15    Ancient tales speak of the Amagheans being descendants of the martyred God-King Arnaz 'the Great Ancestor' and his child Parnaz 'the Great'. Infamous for their religious zeal and warrior culture, they are often said to be unafraid of death itself when in combat - in fact, falling in battle is considered the most noble way one can die in their culture. The Amagheans have a long history of practicing slavery, for they believe all peoples to their east deserve to be punished for aiding Azot 'the Kinslayer'. Some of these cultures have, over many centuries, even been entirely eradicated because of their disloyalty, yet some have stayed in the good graces of their masters, such as the Draneti. With the arrival of [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] influence to their homelands, the Amagheans were awed by their foe's prowess and valor, and many were even open to the idea of adopting the Aversarian rites.

 amsari_desc:89 "#size:15    Few peoples have endured such enslavement and oppression as have the Amsari, and fewer still have done so and survived.\n\nFrom the dark days of slavery at the hands of the Ran Kemsari the Amsari have risen far. It was their prophet who foretold the freedom of the Zarasadari peoples, and their warriors and magi who made good on that promise of liberation. Every Amsari child learns this from birth, and as a result their culture has developed a deep and abiding pride in their status as free men and women. The very idea of enslavement is considered abhorrent to their society, something born of a nightmare conjured out of the darkest days of their history. Legally, any slave who remains on Amsari soil when the sun sets is immediately rendered free - though actual enforcement of this law upon those foreign merchants foolish enough to bring their slaves with them has been lax at best.#"

To violate hospitality is worse than death to any honorable Saruyad and their folk traditions are replete with stories of great and bloody clan wars and feuds stemming from such slights. Another well-kept secret is the unusually active amount of magical blood found particularly amongst the commoners.

Consider neither Iyrossi or Aversarian enough by their kin, they have been blamed both for the start of slave revolts and their failure. Despite this a strong sense of identity emerged within the Jassi due to their shared grievances, not clouded with delusions of the past, for the Jassi had also been slaves and nothing else, they saw the squalid conditions their people put up with for what it was, and wished for better. Treated with contempt by both the oppressors and oppressed made its mark on the fledging peoples, for as the slave revolt spread to their plantations and factories, the Jassi made no exception for those that had wronged, Aversarian or not. The Jassi represent the amalgam of the various cultures brought to work in Malcois and perhaps its future.#"
 
 jayakayin_desc:90 "#size:15    Strikingly harmonious and level-headed when dealing with each other, the Jayakayin are one of Kashirya’s most egalitarian societies. No member is allowed to fall into destitution, and none may hoard too much wealth and power — their rulers usually being elected in large gatherings of the local community.\n\nInternal warfare is rare among the Jayakayin, as intentionally harming their brethren is considered a grave dishonor. This makes them prefer banishment over execution, even in the most justified of circumstances.\n\nHowever, foreigners receive none of these privileges. The Jayakayin are some of the most ruthless corsairs on the Pirate Coast, with a particular penchant for slave raids and infamous for double-crossing prospective buyers, often robbing, enslaving, or killing them."
 
 kadwana_desc:89 "#size:15    The Kadwana are an isolated people that live along the Katuppilan groves in southern Kashirya. They are primarily a fishing society; their communities consist of floating villages on the water and small ports along the groves edge that reach out into the sea. Due to the unwieldy nature of the Katuppilan and the dangers of its waterways, the larger polities of the region have often either left the Kadwana alone, or brokered deals with the local nobility.\n\nTheir long history living on the water has made the Kadwana excellent fishers and weavers. Most goods leaving their ports for wider Kashirya are sea foods and intricately weaved goods. The matriarchs of families are known to record their family's history through the use of skeins- long lengths of yarn knotted and weaved into patterns that detail the lives of their ancestors. Some skeins have been kept since before the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] though many were lost or destroyed in the ensuing disasters.#"
 
 karana_desc:89 "#size:15    The Karana of central Kashirya are famed for their dislike of scholarly arts, instead dedicating much of their intellectual efforts to the preservation of their massive agricultural communities. Karana build their farms like cities, long rows of huts and homes alike with many hands to tend to the vast expanse of crops that stretch across the landscape. Travellers cannot walk a single mile without the sight of small towers dotting the landscape, where local intellectuals watch over the farms and study means to increase their efficiency.\n\nWhile the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] vindicated the culture's outlook on such arts, the violence endured against the Karana in the [dharya_varha|E] devastated many communities and forced a migration toward the Kharadan mountains.

 karkit_desc:89 "#size:15    The Karkit are the scions of the few Karana who fled westward of their ancestral homeland rather than east, trapped in a land of harsh hills and untameable forests. As a result of living on such an alien frontier of their home region, the Karkit lifestyle diverged significantly from their mountain-bound cousins. Instead of agricultural cities, the Karkit build small homesteads with lush gardens around them as a perimeter. One in every seven boys is chosen to train as Garden Warden, trained both martially and horticulturally. This guardian protects the humble gardening communities from their less passive neighbours, although a lone protector has historically not fared well against anything more threatening than lost bandits.\n\nA Karkit homestead usually consists of a single clan formed of seventeen families, between which childcare and medical assistance is a shared duty. Slow to trust but possessive of those they love, Karkit culture is built around a shared struggle in a land that is not their own. Whilst the young amongst them often pine for their lost home found only in songs and stories, the elders are known to be fiercely proud of the hills they have tamed.#"

Their storytellers speak of a wondrous land with a sprawling and splendorous metropolis at its heart, a city that they say possesses a name unutterable by man. Yet, they also recount many other tales, of which many speak of a great tyrant called the 'Stymialtr' who was a cruel and capricious ruler despised by the Karzarad and the hardships they endured under his oppressive rule.\n\nSome learned scholars have proposed that these stories seem to hold a kernel of truth within them, though greatly embellished.

This, in turn, has led to their culture increasingly becoming the metropolitan one of the nobility, as the other cultures of Chevalie slowly drift towards it. It is normal to find Voyagens employed as explorers, soldiers or in other such pursuits, and they are the face of the Marches to the outside world.\n\nVoyagen tradition places a large emphasis on individual accomplishment, and cooperation between them can be difficult.
