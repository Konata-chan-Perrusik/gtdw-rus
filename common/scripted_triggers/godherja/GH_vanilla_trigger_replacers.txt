## This file is like 0000_GH_vanilla_trigger_swaps but instead of being like-for-like
## swaps of vanilla triggers and such, this is instead for new triggers to be created
## to replace vanilla references - normally as a placeholder until we can do a proper
## crack at something. For example: vanilla checks for having christian_religion are
## replaced by GH_REPLACER_is_christian_religion_trigger
