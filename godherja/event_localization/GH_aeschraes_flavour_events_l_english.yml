 aeschraes_event.d.0001:0 "Curse her. Curse that swine of a woman. [aeschraes_rant_axi.GetFirstName] hounded me her entire life. She hounded me until I finally proved to the world how much better I was. Until I killed her like the snake she was.\n\nAnd yet, she hounds me from the next world too. Despite everything I have accomplished. I am Aautokratir, I am the Purest, I am the victor of the world's great battle. And yet I still see her in my mind's eye, challenging me.\n\nShe haunts my thoughts, a lingering specter of the past refusing to fade away. No matter the titles I bear or the victories I've claimed, the memory of Axiaothea persists like a relentless shadow cast upon the canvas of my mind.\n\nCurse her, I often mutter under my breath, as if the words themselves could exorcise the ghostly presence that refuses to be banished. Even in the grandeur of my court, surrounded by the trappings of power, I am haunted by the echoes of our shared history."

 aeschraes_event.d.0002:0 "In shadows deep, a figure vile,\n\nA conniving little turd, oh guile!\n\nWith every word, a twisted scheme,\n\nDeception woven, a ... the devils dream?\n\nLifting my pen from the page, I understand it feels good to work towards something like this poem. [aeschraes_rant_rival.GetFirstName] has been a thorn in my side for far too long and I am ready to explode. This letter will be delivered to their residence tomorrow, and after [aeschraes_rant_rival.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] reads it, it will promptly explode in oh so much fire."
