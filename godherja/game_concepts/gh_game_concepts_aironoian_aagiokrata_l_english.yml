 game_concept_cosmopolitan_eastern_aversarians_desc:0 "Aironoian Aagiokrata is a peculiar mixture of dozens of local religions, faiths and cults, born from the cosmopolitan trade cities dotting the eastern coast and rivers. The priests of this branch wear masks like those of the Öltenic as their physical form may only be seen by the Purest upon their death. A caste system based around which particular cult or profession one belongs to was inspired by the practices of the eastern Kashiryans along with hundreds of their infinite gods, leading to professions all worshipping separate patron deities (ostensibly different First Men). Perhaps most obvious of all, Cuthanagi river worship has slowly become a core tenet of the eastern cults, great processions of faithful parading every time their rivers flood and the faithful filling them with floating lanterns."
