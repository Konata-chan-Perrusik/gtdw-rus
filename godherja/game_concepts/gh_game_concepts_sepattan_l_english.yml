 game_concept_twin_deceivers:0 "Twin Deceivers"
 game_concept_twin_deceivers_desc:0 "In the beginning, the mighty Twin Gods Jerniem and Tarfal gathered the Nattanan and taught them the True Path. Korlacu the younger brother was entrusted with using fire to cull overgrowth and to shape the surrounding mountains to protect against invaders. After a time, Korlacu was gradually neglected and ignored, for the Twin Gods had grown comfortable with their perfect garden of Nattanan and did not want to burn parts down to bring natural renewal, deciding to feed their growth by magic instead. \n\nOver time, it became apparent to Korlacu that fire had no place in a world under Jerniem and Tarfal’s control and so began to wander Aeras in search of inspiration and enlightenment. Seeing the ways of the outside world, he was entranced and amazed by all that man had accomplished when not following the Twin Gods’ rules. He told others of his discovery and taught them new magic and methods - a decision that would lead to [Concept('korlacu_prophecy','tragedy writ in flames')|E]."

 game_concept_korlacu_prophecy_desc:0 "When the Twin Gods heard of Korlacu's heresy, they confronted their younger brother and sought to kill him under a sign of truce. While taken by surprise, Korlacu was able to weaken them but eventually succumbed to the overwhelming force of his two adversaries. Having defeated the mad god, the Twin Gods initially rejoiced. However, their celebrations were cut short when they returned to the Sacred Grove to find the entire garden ablaze. As they sought to extinguish the fires, Korlacu’s voice echoed out across the verdant grove and uttered the following prophecy: \nFrom ashes, the Flame God will rise, \nTo burn the garden 'neath scarlet skies. \nThe twin gods’ reign shall swiftly fall, \nAs fire consumes, it conquers all."

 game_concept_great_betrayal_desc:0 "In the ancient past the Twin Gods Jerniem and Tarfal established the Nattanan way of life to live with nature, their younger brother Korlacu the god of fire was necessary to make Jerneim’s kill safe to eat. While at first, he endeavored to support the true Path in this minor role he eventually wanted more. Becoming arrogant, he sought to create his own path by wandering the world and was corrupted by it. \n\nHe then returned seeking to corrupt the Nattanan having built a stone fortress teaching evil magics. When the twin gods heard of this, they confronted the dark flame filled Koralcu hoping to undo the corruption, sadly they were attacked and forced to kill him. In their mercy, they banished the followers of Korlacu to the northwestern mountains of Kharadan known in the local tongue as Korlacu’s Spine or Chan Kyawkorlacu, and then withdrew themselves from the world to let the Nattanan follow the path on their own."

The Hunt first involves emulating his feat of ritualistically crafting a bow from magically hardened vines. Those successful in doing so are then tasked to hunt a creature designated as the Jersugu, or prey, by the High Priest of the Sepattan in order to maintain balance in the jungle. \n\nEach year, the Jersugu may vary and can range from a pack of ravenous beasts, a certain species of fruit bat, or a magical beast from the deep jungle - all depending on what is needed to achieve true balance."
