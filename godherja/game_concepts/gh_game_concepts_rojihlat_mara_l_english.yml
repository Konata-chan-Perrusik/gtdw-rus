 game_concept_thu_usiktwe:0 "Thû Usiktwě"
 game_concept_thu_usiktwe_desc:0 "The Thû Usiktwě, or the Time of Fear, was a dark age of the Mtuwê during the late 8th century, which began when the Kyaali [magi|E] Xibal performed the long-thought impossible feat of assuming the form of the Tshê-tlâ, and used his power to conquer much of Southern Rojihlat Mara. It is said that Xibal implanted Tshê-tlâ ants in the brains of both the living and dead, which allowed him to control their bodies as he saw fit. Xibal himself was thought to be invulnerable due to his power, leading to a period of complete domination in the south by the warlord.\n\nThe Thû Usiktwě ended after Xibal's death at the end of the century, after he spontaneously combusted into a pillar of flame. The Kyaali took this as a sign of divine intervention and swiftly destroyed the remnants of Xibal's armies, which was greatly lessened after the death of the Magi. The suffering and devastation caused by Xibal nearly killed out the Kyaali, and splintered its worshippers into separate and isolated tribes."

 game_concept_samhatepaya_desc:0 "The Samhatèpaya, or "Great Landing" in the tongue of the Hmacèak, refers to their arrival and subsequent invasion of Southern Rojihlat Mara at the beginning of the 9th Century. While normally difficult to conquer due to their knowledge of the terrain and their own tenacity, the native Mtuwê have been recently weakened by the events of the [thu_usiktwe|E], which decimated much of their population. The Hmacèak were able to easily defeat the Mtuwê forces, cementing their control over the various tribes of the South."

 game_concept_kyaldzakaxi:0 "Kyaldzàkáxi"
 game_concept_kyaldzakaxi_desc:0 "The Kyaldzàkáxi, or Four Heavenly Beasts, are the highest order of creatures in the Kyaali faith and are believed to hold the greatest amount of divinity inside. The creatures are among the most powerful and dangerous seen in [aeras|E], and a person successfully assuming the skin of one is regarded as part-divinity themselves by the Kyaali. Many of the Kyaali's greatest champions and heroes wear the skin of the Kyaldzàkáxi, which they believe also grants the wearer power based on the creature worn.\n\nThe Bàqtsàkhá, or Roaring Lizard, is the greatest of the Kyaldzàkáxi, befitting of its epithet as the "King of Cyrat". The rare persons who are able to wear their skins are often marked in history as the greatest leaders of the Kyaali. The Kísôxdzi, or Twin-Serpents, are often worn by great diplomats, while the wearers of the Thukâ, or Nagual, are swift and powerful warriors. The Ekâtsu, or Adze, has been worn least of all by the Kyaali, and is said to grant the wearer invisibility and knowledge of how the body's blood flows, making them skilled healers and agents.\n\nIt is said that this group was once the Kyaldzàkwàxná, or Five Heavenly Beasts, but whichever creature was once the fifth, and the reason for its removal from worship, is now lost to time."

 game_concept_kyalmuku:0 "Kyalmúkû"
 game_concept_kyalmuku_desc:0 "The Kyalmúkû or Godhunt, is a ritual conducted by the Kyaali where they go forth to Kyaal to hunt one of the [kyaldzakaxi|E] and bring back its skin to wear. As a rule, only the strongest Kyaali participate in the Kyalmúkû due to the dangerous nature of their quarries as well as their hunting grounds. The Kyalmúkû ends with a ritual wearing of the skin by the hunter, with success only being attained if the hunter survives the skin-changing ceremony. Those who do so are revered by the Kyaali, believing that it is Kyaal's acknowledgement of the hunter's worth and power."
