 game_concept_battle_of_the_wall_of_astila:0 "Битва у Стены Астилы"
 game_concept_battle_of_the_wall_of_astila_desc:0 "Битва у Стены Астилы стала заключительным сражением в эпоху [Concept('bayyuralar','Байюралара')|E]. Произошедшая у ныне известной как Стена Астилы, она началась, когда Байтор повёл свои силы на выручку клану Корсакай-хатан, переправившемуся через реку и вступившему в бой с астилийцами. Превосходимые в численности и подготовке, воины Корсакай-хатана отчаянно оборонялись в ожидании подкрепления. Однако при переправе через ручей конь Байтора оступился, сбросив всадника. Хроники расходятся в деталях: брат Байтора и его оруженосец Могха писали, что тот разбил голову о камни и был унесён течением, а предводитель хайашегов Оготэй Танхатан утверждал, что доспехи и маски поверженных врагов потянули его на дно, не дав всплыть. Так или иначе, Байтор утонул до того, как хайашеги успели его спасти. Его тело и меч деда, [iorne_seld|E], навсегда исчезли в речных водах.\n\nГибель вождя посеяла панику: многие кланы рвались отступить. Но Оготэй и Могха, объединив силы, повели войска через ручей в яростную контратаку. Несмотря на отчаянное сопротивление, объединённое войско ольтенов и остатки клана Корсакай-хатана были отброшены за реку. Впоследствии орда распалась, положив начало [Concept('aironoian_migration','переселению')|E].\n\nЭта битва нанесла последний удар по [Concept('otachedian_empire','Империи')|E], вскоре павшую. Однако она же привела к расцвету ольтенских культур и верований в Айроной и зарождению новых империй в последующие века. Даже выживи Байтор, исход сражения вряд ли изменился бы: ольтены уступали астилийцам в вооружении, выучке и знании местности, а отказ Байтора привлечь каширских союзников оставил его войско лишь с [Concept('magi','магами')|E]-шаманами, бессильными против животными-магами Астилийской империи."

После гибели Кагакатан Байтора его войско распалось на враждующие группировки, вытеснявшие или ассимилировавшие местные народы на захваченных землях. Наиболее влиятельным среди них стал Корсакай-хатан, выживший в битве, но оставшийся хромым после удара топором в бедро.\n\nНесмотря на то, что клан Корсакай-хатана был почти уничтожен, его воинское мастерство и харизма позволили подчинить других вождей. Вскоре он провозгласил себя хаякатаном (верховным правителем). Прочие влиятельные хатаны из войска Байтора последовали его примеру, но их империи рассыпались сразу после их смерти, тогда как держава Корсакая пережила его на целое поколение.\n\nБольшинство ольтенов, следовавших за Байтором, остались в Айроной, чтобы строить новую судьбу. Остальные же вернулись в Каширу с Оготэем и Могхой или откочевали в иные земли. Особенностью переселения стал культ Байтора как героя, павшего до срока. Этот образ насаждал Корсакай, боготворивший полководца, тогда как Оготэй и Могха по возвращении в Каширу объявили его виновником катастрофы."

Выжившие чарчаки клялись, что его кавалерия напоминала пылающие колесницы, вырвавшиеся из царства богов, дабы покарать «безумного короля Сванти» за богохульство. В хаосе ближайшие соратники Кренверсо предали его, вынудив бежать на восток и отказаться от цели.\n\nЭтот разгром стал началом конца [Concept('charchac_revolt','восстания')|E]. Стремясь вернуть утраченное величие, Кренверсо казнил всех бывших союзников, которых смог найти. Зрелище обезумевшего чудовища без кожи, терзающего тех, кто некогда звал его «другом», сеяло ужас.

The battle lasted for fourteen days, with the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] legions led by [agos_slyn|E] weathering several charges by the Öltenic horde of [jajak_otroka|E]. In the midst of the fierce battle, the Kashiryan warlord [akhasar|E] suddenly appeared, somehow rising out of the shallow creek with hundreds of guerillas.\n\nHis appearance shocked the Aversarians and Ölteni alike, as he emerged bearing what seemed to be [iorne_seld|E]. Enraged that a foreigner dared claim the legendary blade of his people, Jajak ordered a rash charge towards the Aversarian camp, where it was said that Agos Slyn was crossing blades with Akhasar. The charge proved difficult due to the terrain and stronger Aversarian rear fortifications, costing nearly half of Jajak's personal guard, with the Öltenic chieftain himself being punctured with no less than six arrows.\n\nTo his dismay however, Akhasar was nowhere to be found, and Agos soon ordered a counter-offensive. Both forces were so damaged that they would break off and quickly retreat — Agos south and an enraged Jajak back north. The news of fifteen legions nearly being shattered caused political wildfire in the east, and nobles began assisting the rebels through sending forces, supplies, or money — leading Agos Slyn to order a [Concept('battle_for_the_aironoiakaan','last-ditch assault on the Aironoiakaan')|E]."

To make matters even more confusing, [akhasar|E] once again appeared in the battle for reasons unknown, leading Agos to abandon his defensive lines and command his legions to encircle and destroy the insurgents — even at risk of leaving fewer men to assault the academy.\n\nTwo more sides later joined the battle, as native insurgents fell upon the three sides and begin an array of hit-and-run attacks. However, the last side was the least expected of all. The Blue Robes, for all of their claims of righteousness, declared Axiaothea's freeing of Aironoi's magically-capable slaves to be illegal, and had re-enslaved several hundred students and teachers. The academy quickly fell into rapid devastation with the slave revolt, and the Tower of Stars began to burn and collapse upon itself.\n\nAt the end of the battle, all forces were bloodied, yet made little gains in any of their goals — all three generals remained alive, the natives had failed to drive out the foreigners, and the academy remained intact. After a day of rest, Velaras 'Bleak Speaker' declared from the walls that the rightful [magi|E] were yet again victorious, and that forever more the academy would hold against any advances.\n\nThe battle came to an end less than a day after, as [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] wiped out the Blue Robes and all combatants within the tower.

The League, led by self-proclaimed 'Sub-Aautokratia' Delendea Bhatajarrax, demanded a six-fold decrease in tariffs, exemption from several mercantile laws, as well as granting Delendea control over the East-River Magistariate. Delendea was even heard to loudly proclaim that she would kill Anesimasios herself should their demands be left unsatisfied.\n\nIn response, Anesimasios ordered the embargo of goods coming from the three cities, in an attempt to resolve the issue without bloodshed. An incensed Delendea unexpectedly ordered the League's forces, along with a contingent of Kashiryan mercenaries, to attack Imperial forces stationed in the area, causing the destruction of several Aironoian noble legions caught unawares.\n\nThe death of Aautokratir Anesimasios and the ensuing [imperial_civil_war|E] resulted in the rebellion being left unchecked for two years, leading an increasingly insane Delendea to declare the region's independence from [aversaria|E]. In 1188 IS however, Axiaothea—seeking to solidify her power base—arrived at Eastern Aironoi and easily crushed the rebellion with her legions.

The final steps to obtaining rebirth through the ritual are unknown, besides the fact that it requires an enormity of sacred blood."

 game_concept_hidden_kings_desc:0 "The 'Hidden Kings' are said to be the true masters of reality by the Cult of Zagrillion Dance, that consider themselves their servants. Men turned gods, they are said to rule from a spiritual realm located within the hollow shell of [aeras|E] sending messages through magic to their followers. The cult treats exposure sickness and mutation as a holy sacrament to be experienced both personally and to be inflicted upon outsiders, all so the faithful may divine the will of the gods in its patterns."
 
 game_concept_origins_of_the_cult_of_zagrillion_dance:0 "Origins of the Zagrillion Dance Cult"
 game_concept_origins_of_the_cult_of_zagrillion_dance_desc:0 "It's commonly suspected that the Cult of Zagrillion Dance likely descended from a slave-cult established by one of the exiles from [aversaria|E],  as its pantheon of "Hidden Kings" is rather obviously cobbled together from the garbled names and personas of reigning Aautokratirs of antiquity."
 
 game_concept_elated_victim:0 "Elated Victim"
 game_concept_elated_victim_desc:0 "A woman of ethereal nature who manifests only within the tentacles of the great and venerable Kesrravarga, beasts notorious for their gluttony native to the Redlands. Her followers preach of the transience of life, and that pleasure must be sought at all costs. They are also known to frequently indulge in massive orgies that involve a mix of both lustful elation and murderous rages."

 game_concept_burning_maiden_desc:0 "According to the legends that surround her, the Burning Maiden is a being that is periodically reborn on [aeras|E] to sow great discord and bring about change. Sometimes under the guise of casting down the wicked and evil, but just as often as nothing more than a power-hungry usurper. The one universal constant of her manifestations, however, is that she always has her life ended in fire, until born anew."

 game_concept_yalgabaot_desc:0 "Yalgabaot is known as the God at the Center of the Universe and the supreme regent of the Unspeakable God, ruling over many other gods. Yalgabaoti cultists believe he and the other gods are incomprehensible and inhuman in aspect and thought; mortal men cannot understand them, and anyone who beholds their physical form is struck dead or is turned mad.\n\nThey believe the Unspeakable God is the originator of all things and the world is just a result of his dreams. That mortals are maggots before the gods"

 game_concept_ertomax: "Ertomax"
 game_concept_ertomax_desc: "Ertomax was the fourth man to win over the disparate tribes of the Aruvasue, at least according to the records of the [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E]. Whilst his kingdom in the second century IS was the most successful state the Aruvasueni had ever seen, many differing stories have emerged about the man. Some stories claim he raised an army from the dead with [dead_magic|E] to conquer his way across Aironoi. Others say that it was his sharp wit and quick hands that won him his crown, charming his way across the lands of the Ja'Rakmari. Some even claim that the man who marched upon the Hill of the Golden Saint was not the same king to return to his capital to feast weeks later.\n\nWhilst a vocal minority at best in the early days of the kingdom, his cult has only ever grown throughout the centuries. Once thought a backwater cult, the Ertomaxist faction of the Zaribat Ekadri attempted to revive the empire of Ertomax in the chaos of the [bayyuralar|E]; instead, the High Priesthood of the Aruvasue shattered, and the glory of both Ertomax and the Aruvasue was permanently muddied."
 
 #DESCRIPTIONS
 
 game_concept_izaerto_bosar_creation_myth:0 "Izáerto Bošáren Creation Myth"
 game_concept_izaerto_bosar_creation_myth_desc:0 "The Izáerto Bošáren believe in the 'Great Void' and its evil creations the 'Thousand Masters'. The Thousand Masters had the power to manipulate stars and would turn whatever living creature they touched into horrible abominations, their human slaves who toiled to create great dark shrines to them included. Humanity, as the Izáerto Bošárians tell, rose up and struck down the Thousand Masters in a horribly brutal rebellion, during which almost all of humanity died. As the Great Void turned its abyssal gaze to watch the destruction, humanity too struck the eldritch being in the mystical infinite plane from which it resided with an attack of the Thousand Master's own creation. Because of this, they claim the world is now doomed, for while darkness is banished, without darkness there can never truly be light and that all history thereafter is thus nothing besides the last pretenses of a dying world.\n\nFinally, they also believe that the counterpoint to the Great Void is a minor deity named the 'Feathered One', a giant mystical bird with rainbow feathers from which all light reflects and gives the world color. The Feathered One swallows the souls of all dying people and lets them enter the eternal paradise within them to live in peace forever while the mortal realm dies. Most foreign observers agree their faith is ridiculous, and the often agnostic faithful normally say that the stories are mostly metaphorical but the Feathered One is truly real..."

Many attempts by [Concept('aversaria','Aversarians')|E] to settle the Fool's Coast have been completely decimated by the curse. Despite its well known lethality, the curse has never afflicted the coast's natives. None know from where the curse originates, though Öltenic myth tells of rival warlords who sought power over a djinn, only for its magic to be turned against them."

 game_concept_jaroc_bitter_root_desc:0 "Generally considered to be the most famous Sjalvolki in [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] legends, Jaroc 'Bitter-Root' was a 10th century Fenvir huscarl who was allegedly exiled after failing to protect their chieftain during a troll hunt. He then wandered into southern Katraddia where he met the Charter of Gisreddean Paladins, a travelling [Concept('marchers','Marcher')|E] mercenary company which he would go on to join. During a job in Aironoi, Jaroc saved Governor Richyic Matriacs from being killed by the [magi|E] Morthor 'the Spider', who Jaroc cut in half with his axe.\n\nAs a reward, Jaroc was hired as Matriacs' personal bodyguard, and was often portrayed in portraits alongside his governor, who would proudly parade him throughout his court for them to ogle at Jaroc's mighty stature and rugged northern looks. Matriacs would later abdicate to his daughter, Maklenda, and went on a journey to Kathun-Kai. Jaroc would dutifully follow him east, where both then left the historical record.\n\nJaroc remained as an extremely popular folk-hero, often appearing as the archetype of a "useful" non-human. Some progressive texts even have him as an example of the failures of Aversarian beliefs on human superiority, which reached an apex during the Agionist Rebellions. Over the years Jaroc has often become mixed in with tales of [sjaljar_jax|E], though Jaroc has still persisted in his own stories just as often."

 game_concept_zelkavani_glassmaking_desc: "Mastery over glass has long been a pillar of Zelkavani society, deeply intertwined with their customs and religious practices. With the practice dating as far back as the third century IS and possibly even earlier, glassware of Zelkavani origin is easily identified by the maker's mark, typically in the shape of a primrose, and can be found as far afield as [kashirya|E] and Dahangon, or even as window panes in the [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] temples.\n\nComing in a vast array of shapes and sizes ranging from diminutive beads, vials, and trinkets to ewers, sculptures, and even large, refractive pyramidia crowning the Kherkeloi stelae, the purity of the Zelkavani glass makes it gleam as bright as the radiant sun."

 game_concept_durgumags_desc: "Durgumags are strange, spider-like creatures that appear as though two thoraxes were fused together by a caterpillar, with one half featuring chitinous arms and eight large, dark eyes. Possessing skin and hair similar to that of a large bovine, durgumags produce the prized silkwool, whose strength and beauty makes it more sought after than any mundane silk or fur."

 game_concept_kherkeloi_tin_trade: "Kherkeloi Tin Trade"
 game_concept_kherkeloi_tin_trade_desc: "Tin and bronze have long been the lifeblood of Kherkeloi economies, fueling the growth of their exalted palace-cities, equipping their armies, and supplying artisans with essential materials. With many local tin mines having long been tapped out and abandoned, a vast trade network has sprung up across Aironoi and parts of [kashirya|E] to facilitate the movement of tin, bronze, and their products throughout much of the known world.\n\nThe most famous part of this network has historically been the land route from the old Astilik capital of Ialyrian to the grand palace-city of Ysanda, passing through the [kalassyan_valley|E] and greatly enriching its inhabitants. Although trade would greatly decline with the advent of the [wars_of_dominion|E], it was not until the conquests of [ertomax|E] when it would be finally eclipsed by the maritime route to the tin mines of [krehejad_biozone|E]."
