 # The Reach
 c_wizardsbridge_desc:0 "Kathanouxa, the Wizard-King, began his grandiose project of connecting the distant banks of the Pathos river here in the 1st century BI.

  b_old_mill_desc: "Generally a direct translation of #italic Old Mill#! in most languages, though some also derive from the [GetCulturePillar('language_marcher').GetName] name of #italic Audmoule#!.\n\n#italic More than a few tales surround the mill that gave this settlement its name, and that has repeatedly been abandoned and rebuilt over the centuries. No one is sure when it was first built, though it was certainly already in existence by the time the Chevalien conquered the area.#!"
 c_wolfsway_desc:0 "Many a traveller has met their end in the treacherous, wolf-infested woodland that lines the right bank of the Pathos. The area is also the last known refuge of direwolves on the Shattered Coast, which has made it somewhat popular among particularly brave and ambitious hunters."
 c_giants_ford_desc:0 "Known variously as either the Giant's or Black Ford, this is the site of one of the most shallow and traversible stretches of the Pathos river; though a human would still need to swim to cross it, local giants are known to be able to wade across on foot."

 c_winehouse_desc:0 "No one is certain why this decidedly non-viticultural [county|E] came to be known by its modern name, though it is generally assumed to be a Chevalien misunderstanding of an earlier Clanlander name for the area."

  b_amphorica_desc:0 "A proto-Aversarian deity of pleasure, M'phiris, had her most prominent centre of worship in this ancient city. It is also commonly regarded as the pioneer and likely namesake of the amphora vessel, though this has been hotly contested by the polis of Imphacro in Sarradon."

 c_aautokrateia_desc:0 "The fertile stretch of land between Argontia and Methoe was disputed by various poleis for centuries before the founding of the Empire until it was ultimately transferred to Dhaci'xen, the first Aautokratir, as a direct holding and source of income. For the next two centuries, the area would be one of the main sources of reliable taxes for the throne, though it would eventually lose its economic importance as vast stretches of wealthy land came into direct Imperial control with Aversaria's expansion. Despite this, it would remain a popular summer palace site for the rest of the Empire's history, even after ceasing to have any special administrative significance after Aautokrata Theyssia's 8th century reforms."
 c_aervalropolix_desc:0 "Also known by its ancient name of #EMP Aspomnox#!, Aervalropol was one of the great city-states of pre-Imperial [aversaria|E], and was most notable as the legendary birthplace of its school of [dead_magic|E].

 # Sarradon
 c_new_yrim_desc:90 "When Qasmud the Illuminated won the throne of [sarradon|E] after a bitter civil war, one of his first priorities was moving the royal seat away from Sihnamiyah, an act which he viewed as a clean break with a past steeped in pagan tyranny and decrepitude. For his new capital, he would choose a site in northeastern Kharadamat, naming it after the mythical Ritualist city of Yrim. For almost the entirety of the realm's remaining history, the kings of Sarradon would rule from this glittering metropole; and even after the kingdom was consigned to history, New Yrim would remain one of the most influential players in Kharadamatian politics."

 c_palmsouk_desc:90 "Founded as a trading outpost in the 3rd century BI, Palmsouk would eventually grow into a prosperous city-state, and ultimately become the seat of a powerful empire that stretched across most of inland Kharadamat during the [Concept('sarradon','Sarradonian')|E] Age of Fire. Though its realm would go up in cinders in [Concept('the_decimation_of_sarradon','Halakdun')|E], the city would nonetheless retain regional importance well into the modern era. "
 c_kamish_desc:90 "The Kamu were an ancient mountain tribe notorious for their regular raids into the Sihnamese heartland during the early history of the Kingdom of Sarradon, even briefly seizing its throne during the chaotic Iron-Crowns Period.

 # Sheharddi City States
 ## Thaliteia
 c_epigrapheia_desc:90 "Epigrapheia was, throughout its millennia long history, often considered the greatest of the Thaliteian Hexapolis. The city's most famous landmark (which also gave it its name) are its ancient system of walls, which bear the accrued inscriptions of thousands of years of civilization upon nearly every free surface. Religious devotionals, royal biographies, mythological stories, and undecipherable texts in languages long lost to time are just some examples of the texts adorning Epigrapheia's primordial masonry."
 c_tanar_desc:90 "A port city of black-stone streets, Tanar has long held a queer and dark reputation in [sarradon|E]. Before the coming of Ritualism, its denizens worshipped a serpentine, anthropomorphic deity of malice and destruction — its crumbling statues and worn-down motifs still litter the city even over a thousand years later. The place has scarcely improved its reputation since these ancient times, however; it is still known to this day as a hotbed of strange cults, practitioners of forbidden magic and hauntings."
 c_the_columns_desc:90 "The remains of a colossal metropole that had already been long abandoned by the time [sarradon|E]'s earliest records were written, the Columns' cyclopean scale has caused many a scholar and folk legend to postulate that they were the work not of man, but of a different race entirely."
 c_mirrorgaol_desc:0 "The Mirrorgaol was the capital seat of the kingdom of Khenemhat, where the mythical Djinn-Kings of old would consort with their ghostly allies. The palace at the city's center has been cordoned off by powerful wards ever since its fall in the great siege of 207 BI, which saw the Kingdom of Sarradon finally overcome the Djinn-Kings' potent magic by means now unknown. This is likely for the better, as the few adventurers that managed to break into the old royal seat and emerge alive brought back tales of twisted, nightmarish corridors of shadow that seemed to defy even the rules of geometry itself."
