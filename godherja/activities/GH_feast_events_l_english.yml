 gh_feast_default.0001.desc:90 ""What is this #EMP garbage#!!?"\n\nA sudden shout thunders above the table, silencing the festivities. Turning my head, I discover [fussy_guest.GetTitledFirstName] in the process of spilling perfectly fine [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetCulturalKumisVariant')] out of [fussy_guest.GetHerHis] cup onto the floor.\n\n"This is the finest alcohol a barbarian like you will ever taste, [offended_guest.Custom('InsultNoun')]!" bellows [offended_guest.GetTitledFirstName], clearly outraged by the lack of [fussy_guest.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] understanding of traditional [offended_guest.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] beverages.\n\n"Don't you dare to compare this #EMP piss#! to fine [fussy_guest.Custom('RegionalAlcoholicDrink')], you savage!" [offended_guest.GetHerHis] opponent hisses, clenching [fussy_guest.GetHerHis] fists. Without intervention, it seems that this argument will inevitably turn into a brawl."

 gh_feast_default.0001.c:89 "Spurning my hospitality has consequences, [fussy_guest.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 gh_feast_default.0001.d:89 "Let it go [offended_guest.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], it is not worth starting a fight over."
 gh_feast_default.0001.e:89 "I see no reason to intervene."
 gh_feast_default.0001.f:89 "Finally, some #EMP entertainment#!."
