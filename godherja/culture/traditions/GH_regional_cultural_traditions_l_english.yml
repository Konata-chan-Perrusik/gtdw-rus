 tradition_dayarkan_warrior_queens_desc:0 "Those who live in the eastern land of Dahangon well remember the great Nari Daya who once stood against invaders and forged a lasting kingdom on the northern mountains. Our neighbors may insist on the superiority of males, but we track our bloodlines through our mothers, and the warcry of powerful Dayarkan women send these foreign 'men' running home."
