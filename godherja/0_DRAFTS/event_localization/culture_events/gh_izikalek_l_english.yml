 gh_izikalek_events.0002.desc: "Troubling news has reached me from the [desecrated_barony.GetName]—a raiding warband under the command of [raider.GetTitledFirstName] has attacked the settlement in a devastating incursion, ravaging the land and setting the buildings aflame.\n\nNot content with merely burning the village down, [raider.GetHerHis] forces have spent considerable time and effort toppling a minor Herdstone that the settlement had been built around, shattering it and defacing the pieces. I cannot claim to know whether such actions have come out of zealotry, anger that the villagers have narrowly escaped into the surrounding countryside, or even pure malice—what is left for us is to pick up the pieces and rebuild, like we have always done."
 gh_izikalek_events.0002.a: "Help them rebuild."
 gh_izikalek_events.0002.b: "I cannot spare any aid at this time."

 gh_izikalek_events.0003.t: "[reformer.GetFaith.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] Priesthood Restored"
 gh_izikalek_events.0003.desc: "Once, [reformer.GetFaith.GetAdjective] was far greater than it is today—carried not only in the private rites of scattered communities and simple blessings spoken in hushed whispers, but also expressed through grand celebrations and joyful gatherings of Nalma's devoted worshippers.\n\nThough those days are now long behind us, tainted by memory as they may be, the past is not today. With the restoration of [priesthood.GetName] under the watchful guidance of the newly sworn [new_religious_head.GetTitledFirstName], it seems that our woes may finally come to an end."
 gh_izikalek_events_0003_tt: "[priesthood.GetName] was re-established"
 gh_izikalek_events.0003.a: "Our traditions are immutable, as they have always been."
 gh_izikalek_events.0003.b: "Much has changed, yet we remember who we are."
 gh_izikalek_events.0003.c: "Let the sacred rites guide us into $nalmavast_high_god_name_possessive$ embrace."
 gh_izikalek_events.0003.d: "Our weakness has been our sin. It shall be so no more."

 gh_izikalek_events.0004.desc: "In a stunning turn of events, [reformer.GetFullName] has restored the long-destroyed [reformer.GetFaith.GetAdjective] priesthood, with the newly chosen [new_religious_head.GetFullName] now leading the revived [priesthood.GetName]. "
 gh_izikalek_events.0004.desc.tradition: "Old traditions still seem to hold sway among the faithful, and grand celebrations have been called to mark this momentous occasion."
 gh_izikalek_events.0004.desc.pluralist: "The reformed faith seems to have incorporated many foreign concepts and ideas from other cultures and religions, becoming even more open and welcoming to outsiders."
 gh_izikalek_events.0004.desc.righteous: "Many obscure and deeply spiritual practices have been incorporated into the accepted religious doctrine, now holding sway over the minds and hearts of the faithful."
 gh_izikalek_events.0004.desc.fundamentalist: "In an unexpected turn of events, the doctrines of the reformed faith now emphasise the importance of action and ambition over the matters of spiritual nature."
 gh_izikalek_events.0004.a: "What a joyous occasion!"
 gh_izikalek_events.0004.b: "More priests, really?"
 gh_izikalek_events.0004.c: "Good for them, I suppose."
