Though it is not yet whole again, and may perhaps never be as mighty as it once was, I have saved our people from certain destruction. Not even the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E] heralded such doom for us, and I have entered into the annals of history as one of the greatest Aversarians there ever was.\n\nAcross the renewed empire, hundreds of statues have been built of me, and thousands of citizens place helmets at their feet and pedestals in emulation of the Stilto Katharoteras, wishing me good fortune and victory. Now that I have done the impossible, many desire to know what title I shall take as a commemoration of this event. Therefore, I shall be called..."

Only in Krehejad has Aversaria survived. Despite the long years of anarchy and civil war, we have pulled ourselves from the fire, and now gaze outwards upon a new world.\n\nAnd in this new world, we are the last Aversarians, the only ones uncorrupted by barbarism. From Stellios, then, will Aversaria now reign, and preserve on these islands the last realm of humanity."

A great debate has erupted among my people, and it falls to me as their leader to decide: shall we cling to the tatters of the [Concept('aversaria', 'Aautokrata')|E] and keep our bloodlines pure, or has the time come to forsake the past and embrace a new destiny?"
