The chaos would devolve into a deadly war between the various Partic. Within this struggle, it's said a number of Partic from every part the Greensea recieved a vision from Draíogann Dtocht to perform a great ritual to escape impending doom.\n\nThrough many years of war, diplomacy, and sacrifice, the group who had seen the vision emerged victorious, and accomplished the impossible: uniting Partic from all scions for the first time in eternity, performing the ritual, and opening a great portal from which the Partic people [ROOT.Char.Custom('ParticToCenware')]"

Closest to Draíogann Dtocht, Brixs Partic did as the Arch-Council decreed in accordance with the Will of the World.\n\nOn the fringes of the Greensea lay the Deorai Partic, exiles, escaped criminals, and their descendants. Without a higher authority to organize under, Deorai developed their own clans and domains. Not completely forsaken, for they could still trade and deal with the Brixs, but never again would they behold Draíogann Dtocht.\n\nHowever, in the Durn Eorad, lay the challengers of the Arch-Council and dissidents to the Will of the World. The third of the Partic - a number nearly as cursed as four - they were punished for their, or their ancestors great misdeeds. Typically forced outside of the Greensea altogether or relegated to it's most treachourous depths."

A circle of ancient and wisened sages, who communed with Draíogann Dtocht, interpreting its messages and visions at their source.\n\nTheir decrees often being archaic and unclear in intention (or perhaps even fabricated for the Arch-Council's own gain), many would dissociate from the Arch-Council, either becoming Deorai Partic, or if they explicitly defied the Will, Durn Eorad.\n\nThese outcasts would be targets of the Arch-Council forevermore. Many times in history they would be named an existential threat to the Brixs Partic, and subject to Wars of Pruning.\n\nWith the Arch-Council having been largely destroyed in an aftershock of [frodbrokna|E], it's unclear how Partic society will take shape in their new homes."
