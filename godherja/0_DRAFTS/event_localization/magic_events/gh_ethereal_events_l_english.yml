 ethereal.0001.desc:0 "Days of research have finally come to a conclusion, with dozens of arcane tomes and scrolls scoured for their insights into the names and ranks of the innumerable Daimones, Archons, Emanations, and Greater Spirits known to practitioners of the [magi]'s art. With sketches of several potential ritual circles as well as the coordinates of their proper celestial and terrestrial co-positioning in hand, only one question remains: whom shall I summon?\n\nThese are beings of great power and ineffable desires. I must choose carefully."

 ethereal.0001.d:0 "Perhaps I'm not ready"

 ethereal.0002.t:0 "A conduit to Beyond"
 ethereal.0002.desc:0 "The first sign of the impending arrival of an Erinitic Devil is the smell of blood, rich and coppery, flooding my nose the instant I finish the final syllable of the ritual incantation. The second is a low animalistic growl coming from no discernable direction, almost below the range of hearing at first, but growing louder and more insistent. Finally the Devil itself arrives, pulling itself from thin air with a billowing cloud of red blood-mist. The blood-red shade hovers before me, its voice a series of animal snarls and inhuman roars which I nonetheless understand.\n\n"For what reason have you drawn me here, mayfly?"\n\nThe threat implicit behind its unspoken words fill the room. I will have to act quickly to either bind this spirit or otherwise secure a pact of communion with it, before it turns on me."
 ethereal.0002.a:0 ""Great devil, I have come seeking you're advice and aid""
 ethereal.0002.a.tt:0 "This is a medium difficulty option, and the Erinitic Devil will not be kind if you fail"
 ethereal.0002.b:0 "Attempt to overpower and bind the fiend to myself!"
 ethereal.0002.b.tt:0 "This is a risky option, and the Erinitic Devil will not be kind if you fail"
 ethereal.0002.c:0 "This is too dangerous, banish the fiend and be done with it!"
 ethereal.0002.toast:0 "You successfully communed with the Erinitic Devil"
