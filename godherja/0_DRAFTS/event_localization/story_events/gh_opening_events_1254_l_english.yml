From infighting across the colonies as the [Concept('the_fog','Fog')|E] swept over the lands in my childhood, to fierce fighting with the Sjalvolki hordes after, nothing besides war. A first battle at 11, a first kill not long after, and a blood soaked path from my homelands in the far east to the warmer weathers of the coast. Bodies the whole way. My life has been war, and it has brought me here. A final stand.\n\nThe [marchers|E] and the Sjalvolki have left me scarred, have left my people scattered, but for the final battle they gather. My men for their part declare me the worldly representation of the Purest, for despite my lack of [Concept('magic','Magical')|E] ability, the First Men themselves heralded me from my cradle to my command post. The Purest himself crowned me with shaking hands. I am the Black Sun. The Aautokratir of the north, and if I am to die, then they shall know my name before I do."

My glorious realm, such a beautiful and intoxicating hegemony ripped shred from bloody shred by a bunch of infantile non-humans and whatever pitiful excuse of a creature you can even call a Sjalvolki!\n\nIt was Ulfirx, that little bastard, my spies told me so.

No, I knows the truth. Ulfirx planned this from the start, for years, for decades even! The boy they claimed is Ulfirx is nothing but a seasoned Sjalvolki warlord, who plotted from the beginning with those bastard mercenaries to ruin me, to destroy my realm! I will not allow it, I WILL bring forth vengeance. Ulfirx will feel true pain as I slice off every single little nub on this grizzled bastard's body! He will not understand the pain I will put upon him! He must be thinking of me right now, doubtlessly he has constantly, priding himself for destroying the ONLY TRUE HIGH KING OF THE ISLES AND ALL OF AVERSARIA'S SEAS, and wondering what he could possibly do next. Well he shall soon know what he should do next, DIE! DIE. DIE. If only he knew, if only he knew what he had stumbled upon, what enemy he had made. I declared a blood debt, an anathema upon his entire house, and I shall take it! Entire leagues of scholars have looked upon my family history and wept as they realized that my blood is so pure, so refined by only the greatest champions, that my ancestors of note were beyond number and count! Legions have heard of my realm and thrown down their arms and taken up plows just at the thought of possibly some day having to face me! All of the [magi|E] of [aversaria|E] have sat in shocked silence, afeared of the mighty power trembling from the Isles! I will make Ulfirx feel pain, I will make them all feel pain. Ulfirx, cultists, mercenaries, MY OWN CHILDREN, and ULFIRX most of all! They'll all know! They will!\n\nI AM THE HIGH KING."

He found a land in turmoil, and his heart was torn as he saw the blood his own people spilt on one another.

When I was born to one of his legionaries and an eastern whore, all would have expected me to have been left on the march or to have been relegated to the train, but Valerix saw not one's race or station, only promise.\n\nValerix is now dead, assassinated no doubt by the Aversarian nobility who were sick of his attempts at ending their cruelty. But they made a mistake, they did not kill his protégé. The men are behind me now, the eastern legion, those thought left behind. Today I will go to my men, I will swear to them on my blood to not rest, to not sleep, until Valerix is avenged and his work finished.\n\nAversaria is dead, but through fire and fury I will reforge it.

Instead of gazing backwards, I have continued to watch the front of our great coalition, following the great Cenware in his march into this dead empire. I was there at Elysia, I stood by his side, and watched as the remnants of this land's old masters were swept aside.\n\nAs reward for my service, I was granted temporary stewardship of the lands taken after the battle. Now, with the remnants of those the Sjalvolki name Red [magi|E] backed into a corner, it is surely only a matter of time before this assignment shall be transformed into permanent rule, if not here, than elsewhere in this land of lush fields. For the future lies not with the children of the Earthshaker, obsessed with their petty feuds. The way forward for my people, for all people, is the world which Cenware is creating."

As most of the Fenvir prepared to make it our people's home and to stand against the Witch-Breaker should his host ever intrude upon their spoils, I rallied those with wanderlust still in their hearts, and with the Old Dog's blessing we took sail once more. In our battered fleet, we sailed ever further, discovering lands and wonders I could have scarcely dreamed, 'till we landed here, further than any other Sjalvolki has voyaged. Still, I know my travels are not yet done. There are riches and glory to be found in Kashirya, but I still recall the stories I heard as a girl.
