 protoshliti.0001.desc:0 "As I stride across the Protoshliti's training grounds, I am met by one of its grandmasters, who arrived accompanied by three warriors with powerful builds — all of whom striding with a quick yet steady gait.\n\n'These are the top warriors of this year's batch of recruits' the Grandmaster curtly says. 'Each of them is worth a hundred of those uncouth barbarians, and they are strong not only of body but also of mind.'\n\nThe Grandmaster's quoted price is prohibitively expensive, but maybe one of these warriors will be the key to future victories..."

 protoshliti.0002.t:0 "Cream of the Crop"
 protoshliti.0002.desc:0 "The gates of the Protoshliti are daunting to those that approach it, their sheer size threatening to overwhlem any who draw near. Nevertheless, my business here is urgent, and I am able to force myself to pass through the gargantuan structure. As I enter the gilded halls of the great fortress, I cannot help but feel trepidation over the people that I am about to meet  —  the best Legons and Legans to have graduated from the Academy's notoriously diiffcult officer training course, each of whom trained in the strategies and tactics of a thousand cultures.\n\nInside a palatial office, I am confronted with the visage of the Grandmaster of the Protoshliti, with three figures seated behind them bearing imperious dispositions. The Grandmaster addresses me in a soft yet powerful voice.\n\n'You stand before those who will shape the future of the [Concept('the_continent','Continent')|E], nay, [aeras|E]. To command one of these generals is to enshrine yourself in the books and songs that shall be written about this age.'\n\nThe seated figures gaze at me with dispassionate, yet calculating eyes. None of them looked particularly heroic, yet I cannot help but believe that each of them are capable of doing exactly as the Grandmaster says. I shiver at the thought, then turn to face the Grandmaster for our negotiations to begin.\n\nThe Protoshliti is demanding a king's ransom to secure one of the three's services, yet it seems this is but a small price to pay for a chance at greatness."
