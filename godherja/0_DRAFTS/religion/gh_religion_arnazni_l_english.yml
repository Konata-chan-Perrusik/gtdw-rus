 arnazni_religion_desc:0 "Arnazni sees the world as a challenge one must overcome to ascend as a god; never cowering away and paying respects to one's most venerated ancestors. With their mythological history centered around the [armazli_mountains|E] and the three gods [arnaz_azot_zalden|E], Arnaz's son Parnaz would soon be crowned high king after slaying Azot. It is from him and his centuries long reign that almost everyone in modern day Amaghea would emerge, with his direct line being considered the purest, and they would rule the land for centuries forming a strong warrior society."

 stone_warrior_desc:0 "This Amaghean cult worships the ten Stone Warriors. Tales speak of these titanic men once serving under Arnaz the 'Great Ancestor'. However, during the usurpation of Azot the ''Kinslayer', they would refuse to bend the knee to such tyranny and so were cursed for what seems all of eternity. The cult claims that one day they will be revived by Arnaz himself, and they would fight a great battle for the freedom of Amaghea."

 western_stranger_desc:0 "The Cult of the Western Stranger pays respects to a nearly mythical being from the far west of Amaghea, as well as their closest disciples. It was when Great Parnaz needed aid more than ever against Azot, that the western stranger appeared with many hundreds of their followers, wielding a level of magical potency unheard of since the early days of the world. The devotees to the stranger esteem magical potency and value magi over others, though warriors are still respected."

 two_sisters_desc:0 "This Amaghean cult worships the two twin sisters named Tetra and Shava. Tales say they were able to predict the future and made many miracles happen within their life. However, when their father was ill and seemingly on his deathbed, the two sisters would fight bitterly over the inheritance. This would lead to both of them falling into the two rivers beside the town; one river would turn into pure white, and the other an abyssal black. People still claim that miracles happen close to these seemingly cursed rivers."

 azot_desc:0 "The Cult of Azot completely eschews the veneration of Arnaz 'the Great Ancestor', whom they consider an upjumped pretender with a legacy built on nothing on lies, and instead worship the eponymous martyred God-King Azot 'the Great'. Unlike most of their other kindred, they deemphasize the importance of martial prowess and valor, instead believing that power in its more general form is the true marker of spiritual ascendance. Furthermore, its adherents generally hold the belief that Azot will one day return to the mortal world and seek vengeance against the children of Arnaz."

The cult's teachings hold that the world has already long since descended into the dark age of moral degeneracy, weakness and effete decadence that Arnaz 'the Great Ancestor' had warned of (most other Amaghean branches holding the view that said era has not yet come) and that salvation will only come with the return of the Truthspeakers. [aeras|E] now awaits their revival by the all-father, and once they retake their birthright they will deliver Amaghea into righteousness yet again and begin an eternal golden age."

They claim that Arnaz was the reason that the heavens were forever sealed off, and that he fabricated reasons for his unjust war of destruction together with his brothers. Azot would soon realize that his elder brother spoke with a forked tongue and ended up casting him down to the crimson abyss. However, it was far too late, and the carnage and destruction from this war made the lands unliveable. The great ancestors gave up their lives to heal the lands. Azot would try to spread the truth; however, he would be savagely murdered by the demon spawn of Arnaz."
