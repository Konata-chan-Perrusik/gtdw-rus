 thixanonic_religion_desc:0 "The Thixanonic Cult, named after the 12th century [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] preacher Thixanon, is a primarily Malcoisiac faith worshipping the divinity of Thixanon (often named 'the Father Dragon' and 'the Drake that Eats the Sun'). Thixanon had been of the Scarlet Chosen before an expedition into an unearthed tomb of unknown origin in Katraddia which would leave him as the sole survivor of the two hundred soldiers, scholars and retainers. It is unknown what Thixanon discovered within (or if he had simply gone mad from whatever horrors killed his fellows) but thereafter he would begin preaching a unique and esoteric faith which proclaimed himself as a dragon manifested within the body of a man with descendance from multiple figures in Aversarian history.\n\nThixanon's rejection of the Purest and the First Men (proclaiming them to be false prophets) and his vilification of the aautokratirs of Aversaria (naming them as demonic puppets attempting to destroy the divine 'Neophonic Sun Dragon') would lead to his casting out from the Scarlet Chosen and the illegalization of his cult. Despite this, Thixanon would grow a massive following in his native Malcois among the widespread religious upheavals following the Agionist Rebellion that would bring the governorate to near-civil war before his murder. Thereafter, the cult would remain a constant thorn in the side of the local governorate, until the destruction following [frodbrokna|E] and the collapse of the governorate led to a new revival. Thereafter, many Malcoisiacs disillusioned with traditional Aversarian ideals would fall under sway of the faith, alongside thousands of freed slaves who Thixanonic preacher's claimed would be worthy of freedom were they to swear themselves to the cult."
