 court.4350.desc:0 "My [concerned_marshal.GetCouncilTitle] has just finished speaking to a pair of charred merchants who limped into my throne room. "A chain of our trading caravans bringing saffron from [caravan_attacker_liege.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier] to [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier] has been raided. The villains were no bandits, but a pack of landed Agionist nobles mounted in [Concept('aversaria','Aversarian')|E] cuirasses."\n\n[concerned_marshal.GetSheHe|U] sighs deeply. "Dunces nostalgic for [Concept('kahdavrakan_supper','massacring our people')] are trying to provoke us to war under their liege's nose. If we retaliate, we risk compromising agreements with [caravan_attacker_liege.GetName] on luxury imports so beloved by our courtiers.""

These dogs drool for holy war, and are trying to provoke [attacked_liege.GetTitledFirstName]. However, I suggest we need the trade far more than any battle—"\n\n"We need no food, only to drink the blood of those who defy the Eight!" bellows [caravan_attacker.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] from across the throne room."
