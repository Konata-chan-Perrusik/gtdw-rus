 game_concept_struggle_catalyst_desc:2 "[struggle_struggles|E] transition between [struggle_phase_phases|E] when certain notable actions are taken, building their [struggle_region|E]'s consensus towards a particular mood. A list of which actions are important in which $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$ can be found in the $game_concept_struggle$ window.\n\n#weak Example: the [struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity|E] of the [ritewars_struggle|E] can transition into either the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E] or the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E]. Murdering an important [character|E] might work towards the former, whilst forming a [marriage|E] [alliance|E] with someone of a different [faith|E] would build towards the latter."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_compromise_desc:2 "Whether through sickness with the strife of the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E] or deft escalation during the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E], the $game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_compromise$ represents a growing accommodation between the Rites. Differences fall by the wayside and shared history and heritage binds former foes together.\n\nThe peninsula stands at a cross-roads: if conflicts reappear, then the [struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity|E] awaits."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation_desc:1 "The product of a notable [struggle_phase_iberia_compromise|E], during this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, relations between the peoples of the Rites grow so cordial that outsiders find their permissiveness difficult to parse. Inter-[faith|E] [marriages|E] are particularly common.\n\nThis can't last forever, though, and abuses of trust will eventually bring the [ritewars_struggle|E] back around to the [struggle_phase_iberia_compromise|E]."

 game_concept_border_raid_desc:3 "This is a special type of [war|E] available between [struggle_involved|E] [rulers|E] of the Rite Wars [struggle|E] where the attacker aims to [siege|E] a specific enemy [county|E] bordering their [realm|E].\n\nThe [war_leader|E] gains [gold|E] for capturing the [war_target|E], which will lose [development|E] and [control|E]. [buildings|E] may also be destroyed, yielding more [gold|E], the chance increasing with [development|E] and [siege|E] [army|E] size.\n\n[war_score|E] will be gained rapidly by the attacker upon [occupying|E] the [war_target|E]."

 game_concept_contract_assistance_desc:2 "This is a special type of [interaction|E] available to [struggle_involved|E] [rulers|E] of the Rite Wars [struggle|E], allowing them to join other [struggle_involved|E] [rulerpossessive|E] [wars|E] in exchange for [gold|E].\n\nPayment is made on conclusion of the [war|E], whatever the outcome, as long as the contractor made a [war_contribution|E] of at least 100."
 
 game_concept_iberian_reclamation_desc:2 "This is a special type of [war|E] available to [struggle_involved|E] [rulers|E] of the [ritewars_struggle|E].\n\nThe attacker aims to conquer a [duchy|E] which contains any [struggle_involved|E] [counties|E] held by an [struggle_interloper|E] or [struggle_uninvolved|E] [ruler|E], or [vassalize|E] them if they hold no land outside that Duchy."
