It is also the most fleeting phase of blood, turning into the less mercurial #BOL Syngos#! as it is tempered by breath. The polluted #BOL Elemochis#! is the last and most base humor, its flame extinguished by the coldness of the material world; in healthy men, it occurs only as a brief phase before being reinvigorated in the heart, but for those creatures that do not possess a #BOL Kairos#! it is the only form of blood that flows through their veins. Many an ailment is a result of an imbalance of the three, and techniques for restoring harmony to this cycle shall be described in the following chapters.\n\nAs the great master Mnestrion wisely noted, however, the greatest remedy is preventative — leading a life as befitting a scion of the First Men and shunning degeneracy."#!"

And the judge of the Mamur came before Yunusfur, and spake to her; ‘Why do you disturb the peace so? The people have grown angry, for they love the baths, and you have torn them down.' And the prophet said in reply; ‘The people wash their bodies, but not their souls; indeed, when they leave the bath-house, their bodies shine like jewels, but their souls remain as black as coal.

One of the patriarchs stood, and replied: ‘But their clan has brought misery to ours; yea, they many times burned down our villages, salted our fields, and took our women.' Yunusfur was not shaken in her resolve, and spake to him: ‘And many times has your clan done the same unto them. When you climb the great steps at the end, you will not remember these petty struggles, but will curse yourself for allowing spite to drive you to sin. You chiefs, you fathers of nations, swear brotherhood to each other, and cease your warring, for there are no clans or tribes at the peak of Sophocos.'"#!"

An inheritor of the First Men? My soul is not subject to the same weakness as those beneath me.

Is the path I walk the one to godhood?\n\nDay 14\nI have begun preparing to use the soul separation ritual on myself. It is clear that the problem was not the ritual itself, but the weak-souled subjects I was testing on. There should be nothing for me to fear, and yet my mind is still filled with hesitation. Still, I am a Magi. I cannot allow fear to cripple me the way it would a lesser being.

 sea_queens_domain_name: "Sea Queen's Domain"
 sea_queens_domain_desc: "Stories and shanties of heroes are prevalent among the peoples of the Western Isles, yet equally numerous are tales of the lords of the deep, strange and mysterious as their enigmatic domain. \n\n Famed among these is the Sea Queen, a mythical figure that ruled over a kingdom beneath the waves. Legend tells that she was once a spell-singer that calmed the seas with songs of salt, yet spurned by her own tribe. She was then said to have walked into the sea in sorrow, being venerated thereafter by a repentant populace as the guardian and protector of the souls of drowned sailors."

 admiral_of_the_deep_desc: "A dread pirate lord of the Western Isles, Ricobert was known for leading his armada deep into Aversaria to gain riches aplenty and was infamous for even raiding fellow pirates. His downfall came, however, when he pillaged a local shrine to the Sea Queen, invoking her anger. \n\n A few nights later, the embattled defenders of another island being raided heard a shrill dark song carried over the water, followed by titanic waves that held the great armada in place. Ricobert and his fleet were then dragged to the bottom of the sea, where it is said that they serve the Sea Queen as her undying thralls to this day."
 minstrel_of_the_reef_name: "Heliod, Minstrel of the Reef"
 minstrel_of_the_reef_desc: "A famed Neophretitan minstrel,  Heliod traveled across Aeras seeking new songs and stories to inspire others. During a voyage to Chevalie, the minstrel was beset by a serpentine beast (allegedly due to his singing) and was shipwrecked on an island that worshipped the Sea Queen. \n\n Intrigued by the songs of his rescuers, he began to make his own odes to the Sea Queen in gratitude, which were said to have pleased her. According to legend, she then taught Heliod her own craft in exchange for his service, and the minstrel thereafter traveled the Isles, bringing joy and calm seas with his songs — some say even after his death."
