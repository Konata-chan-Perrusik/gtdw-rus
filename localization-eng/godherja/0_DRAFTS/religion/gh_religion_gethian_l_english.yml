 gethian_religion_desc:0 "Gethian cosmology says that in the earliest of days, the first humans greatly dishonored the Great Judge Atrākh-Admākh. This sin, they claim, was so offensive and heinous that its specifics have been lost to time, for none dare to utter its vileness. The Great Judge was wise but stern, and told humanity that they shall not be judged by that one act alone. He would quit this world for a long time, and when he returned, he would judge mankind and see whether they have done enough good to outweigh their unspeakable sin."
