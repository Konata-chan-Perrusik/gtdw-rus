 hulawite_religion_desc:0 "Literally meaning 'Wilderness', Thursiyyah is a catchall term for a series of rationalist and phylosophical movements which arose from the courts and intellectual life of 8th century [sarradon|E]. They are based around a strict rationalist understanding of [aeras|E], an unshakable belief in the potency of human logic and reason, and an explicit rejection of both Wardenism and Ritualism. Some Thursite sects have gone so far as to espouse true atheism, courting continent-wide scandal and disrepute. Others have taken to worshipping saints or divinities associated with illumination and reason."

 hulawite_adherent_plural:0 "Hulawites" 
 hulawite_desc:0  "A rationalistic and experiential philosophy founded by the Adar the Nib, a notoriously irascible scholar and philosopher of the late 8th century blooming of the Mamural courts. Initially working within the confines of an intellectually liberated form of Traditionalist Wardenism, [Concept('adaric_philosophy','Adar`s theories')|E]  evolved to the extent that they effectively rendered him an apostate. His followers to this day are saddled with the label "Hulaw", meaning "truant" after the wording of a judgement by the High Court of the Center shortly following his death.\n\nThe insult from the courts was ultimately impotent and without Mamural backing, and his heirs quickly began to self-identify with the label out of a shared love of ironic humor."

 beshashuriyya_adherent_plural:0 "Beshashites"
 beshashuriyya_desc:0 "A philosophical, political, and religious movement centered around the figure of [ishtabima_mamura|E], who served as a general and bodyguard under first [sanad|E] and briefly her husband [tathtali|E]. In the generations since since her death, Ishtabima's life and military career saw her elevated to near-sainthood amongst the Beshashuyriyya, who view her as a paragon of martial honor and fidelity. Notably, the Beshashuriyya strive to approach martial pursuits in the same way scholars and legalists pursue their own fields. Many outside the sect consider this to be an absurd justification for raising a (likely) lowborn woman to a nearly divine status."

 anban_sarradon_desc:0 "A cult founded in the wake of the Frodbrokna. The Anban is a deliberate and somewhat cynically pragmatic attempt to unify both Wardenism and Ritualism into a singular faith based around the figure of an immaterial godhead lawgiver. Partially a political philosophy, its idealistic proponents offer it as a method to unite Sarradon and usher in a new age of religious peace. For somewhat obvious reasons it has generally struggled to find popular support outside of a handful of warlords looking for any kind of edge over their rivals."
