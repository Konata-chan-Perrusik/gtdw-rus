  game_concept_karannai_ritual_consumption_desc:0 "The Karannai practice a belief that the consumption of other beings, if prepared following the exact steps of an intricate ritual, will grant the eater some of their meal's power and characteristics. Thus, the consumption of a bear will bring strength, while eating a falcon grants agility — and eating a [magi|E] bestows arcane power. The consumption of Karan, the Dessicated God, itself is believed to grant one divinity, and many of the Karannai have perished in their attempts to do so."
