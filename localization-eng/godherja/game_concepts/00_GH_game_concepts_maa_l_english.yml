 game_concept_monsters_desc:0 "Ferocious [Concept('creature','Creatures')|E] found in the wilds ranging from [griffons|E] to [dragons|E], whether tamed or enchanted, they and their handlers now form a regiment of [men_at_arms|E].\n\nMonsters are extremely varied and while normally weaker than traditional soldiers their variety and uniqueness means they [counter|E] most human armies. Monsters are however weak to Adventurers who specialize in their hunting." # GH URGENT: Add Adventurer type unit with counter to monsters - Anti-Magi probably fit here

 game_concept_gh_general_undead:0 "Undead"
 game_concept_gh_general_undead_desc:0 "The bones of countless men that died in ages past, risen as [men_at_arms|E] to carry out the nefarious will of their lords. The undead have no inherent [counters|E], but come in versions of all other units.\n\nThe undead are generally weaker than their living equivalents, but make up for this in numbers and [toughness|E]."

 game_concept_constructs:0 "Constructs"
 game_concept_construct:0 "Construct"
 game_concept_constructs_desc:0 "Man-made constructs animated by [magic|E] carrying out the will of their arcane creators as [men_at_arms|E]. No two units of Constructs are the same and they can fill a variety of auxiliary roles such as in [siege|E] or as devastating soldiers in [battle|E]. While they have no true [counters|E], many [magi|E] are trained in their destruction, and they are generally unable to [screen|E] or perform a [pursuit|E]."

 game_concept_magi:0 "Magi"
 game_concept_magi_possessive:0 "Magi's"
 game_concept_magi_desc:0 "Magi are individuals with the blessing—and curse—of [magic|E]. Employed as [men_at_arms|E] within armies of all types across [aeras|E]. [magi|E] have no inherent [counters|E] but can themselves [counter|E] most mundane units and are extremely dangerous in [battle|E] and [siege|E].\n\nDespite their strength, they often only form in small number and for high cost, and many units specialize in their destruction."

 game_concept_magical:0 "Magical"
 game_concept_magical_desc:0 "Magical [men_at_arms|E] are beings such as Spirits, Elementals and other immaterial [Concept('magic','Magical')|E] creatures. Magical units are exceedingly dangerous, with very few [counters|E], little [terrain|E] limitations and often an extreme resistance to mundane arms.\n\nThey are offset by their rarity, normally only appearing naturally or after summoning by intense magics."

 game_concept_flying:0 "Flying"
 game_concept_flying_desc:0 "Flying beasts and creatures of all sorts either alone or with experienced riders, aerial [men_at_arms|E] can easily harass enemy troops in [battle|E]. Most flying units [counter|E] almost all landlocked units and receive no penalties for [terrain|E], though are less effective at attacking units concealed in Jungles, Taiga, Forests and Wetlands. They are normally only vulnerable to [archers|E], [magi|E] and Adventurers." # GH TODO: Adventurers

 #game_concept_adventurers:0 "Adventurers"
 #game_concept_adventurer:0 "Adventurer"
 game_concept_adventurers_desc:0 "The second oldest profession on [aeras|E]: thrill seekers, treasure hunters and beast slayers often gather as mercenary [men_at_arms|E] to deal with extraordinary threats. Adventurers generally perform poorly in [battle|E] compared to trained soldiers and enlist in much smaller number, but they excel at [Concept('counter','countering')|E] [monsters|E] and are the most common Counter against [Concept('magic','Magical')|E], [flying|E], [constructs|E], [gh_general_undead|E] and [magi|E].\n\nWhile they form a poor army, every sensible general knows to always keep a party on hand to deal with less traditional threats and difficult [terrain|E]."

 game_concept_chariots:0 "Chariots"
 game_concept_chariots_desc:0 "The venerable Chariot has been used in Battle by trained Men at Arms through most of the worlds history, with it appearing famously in many battles such as the Battle of Ten Lakes and Four Days when the Astiliks routed the forces of the Imperial Army sent to conquer Aironoi (a feat rarely repeated thereafter). Chariots are horrifically deadly in the open plain where they form a rapidly moving wall of death led forward by anything from teams of warhorses to beasts and creatures of all kinds - the Aversarians of the Late Empire going so far as to create chariots that could float onward without an animal at all. Chariots are extremely effective against all Infantry and are far Tougher than cavalry, but also have much less ability to pursue or counter larger threats. Outside of the Plains however they are effectively useless, Forests, Mountains, Wetlands and most other Terrain proving a significant challenge, and this along with their high cost and small number has led to the Chariot to wane into relative obscurity." # GH TODO: Shrink
