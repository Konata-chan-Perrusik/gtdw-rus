 game_concept_wars_of_pruning_desc:0 "The Wars of Pruning were various [great_holy_wars|E] called by the [Concept('the_druid_arch_council', 'Druid Arch-Council')|E] directed against the Deorai Partic, or more likely the Durn Eorad, with the goal of exterminating said groups. Typically justified by the Arch-Council's claims that it was the Will of the World, many of these conflicts would, ironically, create new Deorai Partic or Durn Eorad, as a number of the Brixs Partic would doubt whether this was a true Will or not."

 game_concept_the_druid_arch_council_desc:0 "The Druid Arch-Council was the magical and spiritual ruling body of the Brixs Partic, who directed and assigned Druid Ollaghs to secular Partic clans, guiding the Brixs Partic in accordance with the Will of the World. The Arch-Council, their readings, and decrees in interpreting the Will, are subject to many differing opinions depending on the [Concept('scions_of_the_greensea', 'scions')|E] of Partic society.\n\nThe Arch-Council would be annihilated in the aftershocks of [frodbrokna|E], with what little survivors in lesser circles fading into the larger society as Ollaghs themselves in the [Concept('the_severing_of_the_vales', 'Severing of the Vales')|E]."

 game_concept_scions_of_the_greensea_desc:0 "Before the Partic were forced to abandon their homeland of the [greensea|E], they were divided among three scions of societal standing.\n\nThe first was the Brixs Partic, those who lived under rule of the [Concept('the_druid_arch_council', 'Druid Arch-Council')|E], and heeded the Arch-Council's proclaimed Will of the World. They lived closest to Draíogann Dtocht, graced by its magical potency.\n\nSecond of the Partic were the Deorai Partic: exiles, or those who grew disillusioned with the Arch-Council. Living on the fringes of Brixs Partic territory, Deorai Partic formed their own clans and Councils, warring and politicking with one another. Depending on the era (and decrees by the Arch-Council), they may or may not have been completely shunned, and were permitted to trade with the Brixs Partic, though they were never allowed into proper Brixs Partic territory itself.\n\nThe third and final of the Partic were the dreaded and cursed Durn Eorad. Hated and outcast for their crimes and atrocities by Brixs and Deorai Partic alike, they were largely driven out of the Greensea or lived in its darkest and most wild areas. Durn Eorad were often known to incite wars with the Brixs Partic in hopes of overthrowing the Arch-Council, oftentimes in retaliation to a [Concept('wars_of_pruning', 'War of Pruning')|E]. However, the majority of Durn Eorad were not these said challengers and criminals, but rather their descendants."

 #HISTORICAL EVENTS/CONCEPTS
 game_concept_the_severing_of_the_vales:0 "The Severing of the Vales"
 game_concept_the_severing_of_the_vales_desc:0 "Though the Partic were kept safe from the rapid spread of [selfreplicating_blood_magic] by their isolation and magical wards, many of their number, especially those most magically strong like the [Concept('the_druid_arch_council', 'Druid Arch-Council')|E] were hit with something akin to a psionic blast during [frodbrokna|E] as Draíogann Dtocht wailed in horror and fear, killing a vast majority of the Partic's most powerful. With the Arch-Council and other lesser Druid Circles utterly destroyed, the surviving Brixs Partic turned to various Deorai Partic clans for aid.\n\nWhat followed in the decades afterward was a bloody, chaotic conflict, with all surviving Partic peoples eventually banding together to assert a new power structure in the vacuum of the Arch-Council. During this, some Partic from across different [Concept('scions_of_the_greensea', 'scions')|E] are said to have received a vision from Draíogann Dtocht, to accomplish a great ritual in preparation for a [Concept('the_fog', 'disaster')|E] to come. Those who had seen the vision eventually emerged victorious, and achieved the impossible feat of uniting Brixs, Deorai, and Durn Eorad Partic together for the first time in history. The victors then performed the ritual at great sacrifice and opened a portal through which the Partic would appear before Cenware and join the Sjalvolki Imperrech."
